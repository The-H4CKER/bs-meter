Main Tree phenological events, encompassing seasonal biological activities, such as budbreak and leaf-out, wield substantial influence over carbon, water, nutrient cycling and trophic interactions within forest ecosystems 1 , 2 . Late spring frost (LSF), characterized by frost events taking place during or after leaf emergence, emerges as a notable threat to tree growth and the functionality of forest ecosystems 3 , 4 , 5 . Trees undergo deep physiological dormancy, termed endodormancy, during winter, which maximizes frost resistance until adequate chilling units accumulate. As spring arrives, trees transition to ecodormancy, accompanied by diminishing freezing resistance and the emergence of new leaves, marking the lowest freezing resistance 6 . The occurrence of LSF after leaf-out can inflict severe harm upon these nascent leaves 7 , 8 . Hence, trees strive to initiate leaf growth as early as possible, optimizing the production of photosynthetic carbohydrates while sidestepping the perils of LSF 9 , 10 . The past decades have witnessed the propagation of earlier spring phenology due to global warming across the Northern Hemisphere 11 , 12 , 13 . This warming-induced advancement in spring phenology contributes to extended carbon assimilation periods but also heightens the risk of LSF 14 , 15 , 16 . Consequently, it becomes imperative to comprehend and model the intricate dynamics between LSF, tree productivity and climate change to establish effective forest management strategies. Sufficient carbon assimilation and storage during the prior growing season are vital for winter survival and supporting early spring leaf growth 17 , 18 . Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), including soluble sugars and starch, peak in autumn before dormancy but dwindle after new leaves emerge in spring 19 , 20 . Frost events amplify stem respiration, intensify carbon depletion and trigger the formation of ice crystals, potentially damaging biomembranes and dehydrating cells, ultimately diminishing stored carbon reserves 7 , 21 . A significant drop in carbon assimilation renders available carbon reserves inadequate for fuelling the energy and osmotic needs of leaf-out 22 , 23 . Consequently, more chilling or forcing units might be needed to initiate spring leaf-out, leading to delayed spring phenology 22 , 23 . LSF may disturb the uptake of photosynthetic carbon and impact the accumulation of chilling and forcing units as supplementary energy sources, thus influencing spring phenology in the subsequent year. However, the interactions between frost, carbon uptake and phenology spanning multiple growing seasons in trees have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we endeavour to unravel the intricate interplay between LSF, photosynthetic productivity and spring phenology across the Northern Hemisphere by combining multiple complementary long-term and large-scale datasets and frost-controlled experiments. Specifically, we embark on deciphering the carry-over effect of LSF on subsequent-year spring phenology and photosynthetic productivity across subtropical, temperate and boreal regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Our hypothesis postulates that the reduction in carbon uptake due to frost triggers an augmented demand for (1) chilling units, (2) forcing units or (3) both, thereby delaying the onset of spring phenology in the subsequent year. This frost-induced delay, in turn, would decrease productivity through a feedback process. Carry-over effect of LSF on spring phenology To investigate the carry-over effect of LSF on spring phenology, we compiled leaf-out records of 870 tree species spanning from 1950 to 2020. These records were sourced from five large-scale ground-based phenological and PhenoCam networks situated in Europe, the United States, China and Russia, spanning diverse climate zones within the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 1a ). The leaf-out dates were used to denote the start of season (SOS) and LSF events were defined as occurrences of daily minimum temperatures dropping below −2 °C after the SOS. We test the impact of LSF on SOS and computed the difference in SOS (∆SOS) for consecutive 2 year periods, per species at each site. Subsequently, we contrasted the differences in ∆SOS when LSF transpired versus when it did not for each species at each site. Positive and negative values of ΔSOS indicated delayed and advanced SOS in the subsequent year (SOS next ) relative to the present year (SOS current ). Through the use of ground-based phenological networks, we found that, in the absence of LSF, the mean ∆SOS remained close to zero, while it was positive (5.70 ± 0.06 days) during LSF occurrences (Fig. 1b ). This observation indicated a significant delay in SOS next attributable to LSF in the current year. Similar results were obtained across diverse ground-based phenological networks and through analysis using linear mixed models (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Fig. 1: Effect of late spring frost (LSF) on start of growing season (SOS) in the next year. a , Locations of the ground-based phenological and PhenoCam network sites. b , Changes in ∆SOS between LSF occurred and non-occurred across all phenological networks, Pan European Phenology Network (PEP725), USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), China Phenological Observation Network (CPON), Russian ‘Chronicles of Nature’ Network (RCNN) and PhenoCam network. c–h , Spatial distribution of mean ∆SOS from phenological products of GIMMS NDVI3g ( c and d ) and MODIS ( f and g ) when LSF non-occurred ( c and f ) and occurred ( d and g ) over the Northern Hemisphere forests. e , h , Changes in ∆SOS between LSF occurred and non-occurred from phenological products of GIMMS NDVI3g ( e ) and MODIS ( h ).

Statistical significance between groups was determined using two-tailed t -test. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in ∆SOS between LSF occurred and non-occurred ( P < 0.01). The box spans from the first to the third quartile, with intermediate values marked as the black line in the middle of the box. In c , d , f and g , the histograms present the frequency distributions of the percentages. Full size image Generalizing our findings, we calculated ∆SOS on the basis of phenological metrics obtained from GIMMS NDVI3g and MODIS datasets spanning 1982 to 2019 (Fig. 1c–h ). The analysis using GIMMS NDVI3g highlighted that 85.7% of forested areas depicted earlier SOS next , indicated by negative ∆SOS values, when LSF did not occur in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 1c ). Conversely, in the presence of LSF, 90.6% of forested areas displayed delayed SOS next (Fig. 1d ). These trends were consistent when using the MODIS data (Fig. 1f,g ). On the whole, SOS next was found to advance by 2.30 ± 0.01 days when LSF was absent, whereas it exhibited a delay of 7.18 ± 0.03 days when LSF was present (Fig. 1e,h ). To ensure the robustness of our results, we further excluded the influence of preseason temperatures on spring phenology ( Methods ). We also observed that SOS next was delayed by LSF after excluding the effect of spring temperature (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2 ). Analogous outcomes were evident across diverse tree species, forest types and climate zones, as inferred from both ground-based phenological datasets and remote-sensing data (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Figs. 3 – 5 ). The observed delay in SOS next was significantly more pronounced in broadleaf tree species compared to conifer species and in late-leafing species compared to early-leafing species (Fig. 2a,b ). Additionally, we observed a significant escalation in frost-induced delayed SOS next as the severity of LSF heightened across various species (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). To assess the robustness of our results, we also examined the impact of LSF occurring 1–8 weeks after SOS and before 15 July on SOS next using a 1 week smoothing window. Consistently, we observed a delay in SOS next , regardless of the temperature thresholds or timing of LSF occurrence (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Moreover, we found that the delay in SOS next due to frost was more pronounced when LSF occurred later compared to earlier in the season. The risk of LSF was also higher for later occurrences compared to earlier ones (Supplementary Fig. 7 ).

In a and b , the Y and N indicate that LSF occurred or did not in each year for each species at each site, respectively. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed t -test.

In c and d , black and red dots represent the LT 50 collected in the literature and predicted by the four-parameter logistic model, respectively. The black lines represent fits from a four-parameter logistic model in c and a linear regression model in d , respectively. The shading represents 95% confidence interval. Full size image Species-specific phenological responses to LSF To glean greater clarity about disparities in the response of SOS next to LSF across tree species, we calculated the lethal temperature at which 50% of leaves were impaired (LT 50 ). We selected long-term and extensive SOS records from the PEP725 network for the calculation of LT 50 . The LT 50 was estimated for all eight species, on the basis of median SOS dates for each species within the PEP725 dataset and six experimentally derived LT 50 values from pertinent literature sources (Supplementary Table 3 ). We observed a strong positive correlation between measured and predicted LT 50 values (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The outcomes revealed an LT 50 range of −8 °C to −2 °C across the eight species, with early-leafing species exhibiting a significantly lower LT 50 than their late-leafing counterparts (Fig. 2c ). Using linear regression, a positive linear correlation was evident between LT 50 and ∆SOS for consecutive 2 year periods (Fig. 2d ). This finding suggested that tree species with low frost resistance experienced a more pronounced delay in SOS next compared to those with high frost resistance when LSF occurred. Interactions between LSF, phenology and productivity To expound upon the frost-induced alterations in SOS next , we examined the discrepancies in gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) when LSF occurred or did not. We found the GPP of the current year (GPP current ) decreased by 13.6% when LSF occurred (Fig. 3a,b ). We obtained similar results using remote-sensing vegetation indices and tree-ring width in the Northern Hemisphere (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10 ). To investigate the effect of LSF on photosynthetic carbon uptake, we conducted frost experiments using seedlings of four widely distributed tree species in subtropical and temperate forests ( Methods ). Our findings revealed a significant decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate, starch, soluble sugar and NSC in tree seedlings when LSF occurred (Fig. 3c–j and Supplementary Figs. 11 – 14 ). These results provide experimental evidence that LSF significantly reduces leaf photosynthetic rate and carbon storage. Fig. 3: Relationships between late spring frost (LSF), spring phenology and photosynthetic productivity. a , b , Changes in annual GPP in the current year (GPP current ) between LSF occurred and non-occurred using phenological products of GIMMS NDVI3g ( a ) and MODIS ( b ). c – f , Changes in photosynthetic rate ( c ), starch ( d ), soluble sugar ( e ) and NSC ( f ) across all tree species in control (CK) and LSF group. g – j , LSF treatment using seedlings from four tree species: Aesculus chinensis ( g ); Liquidambar formosana ( h ); Phoebe chekiangensis ( i ); Quercus glauca ( j ). k , l , Piecewise SEM considering both LSF and GPP current using phenological products of GIMMS NDVI3g ( k ) and MODIS ( l ). m – p , The percentages of pixels with significant correlations (Frequency) ( m ), average correlation coefficient ( R ) ( n ), root mean square error (RMSE) ( o ) and Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) ( p ) between model estimates and satellite-derived observations using the GDD, SW, SM, PM and corresponding modified models with GPP effects. In a and b , the Y and N indicate that LSF occurred or did not in each year at each pixel, respectively. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed t -test. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in GPP current between LSF occurred and non-occurred ( P < 0.01). In c – f , the asterisk indicates a significant difference in photosynthetic rate, starch, soluble sugar and NSC between CK and LSF group ( n = 36, P < 0.01). The box spans from the first to the third quartile, with intermediate values marked as the black line in the middle of the box. In k and l , LSF, GPP current and start of growing season in the current year (SOS current ) were incorporated into the SEM to explore the direct (arrows from each factor directly pointing to the SOS next ) or indirect (arrows from each factor firstly directly pointing to GPP current then to the SOS next ) effects of factors on spring phenology in the next year. Different letters indicate significant differences in GPP current and SOS next between LSF occurred and non-occurred ( P < 0.01). The calculated P values based on two-sided test and other statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 4 . In m – p , the error bars indicate standard errors of the mean ( n = 10,698). Full size image To bolster these findings, a piecewise structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to probe the direct and indirect effects of LSF on GPP current and SOS next . The SEM outcomes unveiled a negative correlation between LSF and GPP current (Fig. 3k,l and Supplementary Table 4 ), affirming the substantive reduction in GPP current caused by LSF. Additionally, SOS next exhibited positive correlations with LSF and SOS in the current year (SOS current ), while demonstrating a negative correlation with GPP current . This finding indicated that a decline in GPP current led to a delayed SOS next . Consequently, the SEM elucidated that LSF exerted a dampening effect on GPP current , thereby contributing to the postponement of SOS next . Analogous outcomes were discerned within NPP current (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 5 ). In addition, we found a significant decrease in GPP current when LSF occurred in both drought and non-drought years (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). To unravel the mechanisms underpinning the correlation between frost-induced carbon reduction and subsequent-year spring phenology, we postulated that trees would necessitate additional chilling units, forcing units, or a combination thereof, to initiate spring phenology following decreased carbon assimilation in the preceding year. To test these hypotheses, a range of process-based spring phenological models were modified by integrating the impact of LSF-induced GPP reduction on spring phenology ( Methods ). We found that the modified phenology models outperformed their respective original versions, and the modified two-phase sequential model (SM), specifically adjusted in the forcing phase, emerged as the optimal model for simulating spring phenology (Fig. 3m–p ). Projected impact of LSF on future spring phenology Using the modified SM, we predicted shifts in spring phenology during LSF occurrences and compared these simulations with projections from temperature-driven coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 (CMIP6) models under diverse future emission scenarios ( Methods ). We found that, in the absence of LSF, the mean ∆SOS was negative (−1.70 ± 0.02 days) (Fig. 4 ). However, when LSF events occurred, the mean ∆SOS remained close to zero (0.67 ± 0.01 days) across all four climatic scenarios simulated by CMIP6 models. Using the modified SM, we found that the mean ∆SOS became positive (5.27 ± 0.03 days) in the presence of LSF under all four future climatic scenarios, with the highest mean ∆SOS (7.33 ± 0.07 days) observed under the high-emission shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP)5-8.5 scenario (Fig. 4i–l ). To reduce uncertainties arising from relying on a single phenological dataset, we further performed the same analysis using daily leaf area index (LAI) data from CMIP6 models under four future climatic scenarios and obtained consistent results (Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Furthermore, using data from all ground-based phenological networks, we observed a rising trend in the mean SOS next attributed to LSF between 1950 and 2020, accompanied by an increased LSF risk (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 17 ). These analyses highlight that the CMIP6 models underestimated the delaying impact of LSF on spring phenology under future emission scenarios. Fig. 4: Projected effect of late spring frost (LSF) on start of growing season (SOS) in the next year at the end of this century (2080–2100) across different models under four climatic scenarios. a – d , Spatial distribution of mean ∆SOS when LSF occurred from the CMIP6 models under SSP1-2.6 ( a ), SSP2-4.5 ( b ), SSP3-7.0 ( c ) and SSP5-8.5 ( d ). e – h , Spatial distribution of mean ∆SOS when LSF occurred from the sequential model (SM) with GPP effects under SSP1-2.6 ( e ), SSP2-4.5 ( f ), SSP3-7.0 ( g ) and SSP5-8.5 ( h ). i – l , Changes in ∆SOS across different models under SSP1-2.6 ( i ), SSP2-4.5 ( j ), SSP3-7.0 ( k ) and SSP5-8.5 ( l ).

Y-CMIP indicates that LSF occurred using CMIP6 models, Y-SM indicates that LSF occurred using modified SM and N indicates that LSF did not occur using CMIP6 models. The SOS dates from 2080 to 2010 were extracted by daily GPP dataset from CMIP6 models. In i – l , different letters indicate significant differences among different models based on Tukey’s HSD test ( P < 0.01). The detailed statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 6 . The box spans from the first to the third quartile, with intermediate values marked as the black line in the middle of the box. Full size image Feedback effect of phenology on productivity To decipher the interactions between LSF, SOS and productivity, we further examined the impact of LSF on the GPP in the next year (GPP next ) when LSF occurred. Results showed that GPP next decreased by 11.2% when LSF occurred (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b ). Furthermore, we observed significantly higher ∆GPP next values when SOS next was advanced, irrespective of LSF occurrence (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f ). Conversely, no substantial disparities were apparent in ∆GPP next when LSF events transpired or not, regardless of the advancement or delay in SOS next . Similar trends were observed within NPP next (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d,g,h ). This suggested that changes in GPP next and NPP next were closely linked to the timing of SOS next . Discussion In addition to the warming-induced earlier spring phenology, the risk of LSF is also increasing 16 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Numerous studies have demonstrated that LSF can severely damage newly developed buds and leaves of trees 7 , 8 . However, the carry-over effect of LSF on vegetation growth and productivity has been largely neglected. By combining multiple long-term and large-scale ground and remote-sensing datasets, we discovered that the onset of spring phenology was significantly delayed in the year following an LSF event, resulting in reduced carbon assimilation in the subsequent year. Furthermore, our results suggested that the delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year, induced by LSF, was driven by reduced carbon uptake in the year of occurrence. As a consequence, photosynthesis was reduced for 2 years following an LSF event (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5: A schematic diagram of the interactions between late spring frost (LSF), photosynthetic carbon uptake and spring phenology. The LSF in the current year could delay spring phenology in the next year by reducing photosynthetic carbon uptake in the current year. This LSF-induced delayed spring phenology in the next year can further reduce photosynthetic carbon uptake in the next year through feedback control. Full size image Effect of LSF on spring phenology In winter and spring, trees typically undergo periods of endodormancy and ecodormancy before initiating spring growth 27 . Trees need to accumulate chilling units (cold temperatures) to fulfil endodormancy, while the accumulation of forcing units (warm temperatures) is necessary to break ecodormancy 13 . Warming springs can lead to earlier spring phenology by accelerating the accumulation of forcing units required for trees to end dormancy 12 , 28 . However, trees also need to assimilate and store adequate carbohydrates through photosynthesis to maintain metabolic processes during dormancy, protect cells from winter freezing damage and support bud development and early spring leaf growth in cold regions 17 , 18 , 29 . When occurring after leaf-out, frost events can decrease photosynthetic pigments (for example, chlorophyll) and even lead to complete and irreversible damage to photosynthesis and photosystems, resulting in decreased carbon uptake 30 , 31 , 32 . Our analysis, based on multiple data sources and frost-controlled experiments, provides direct and robust evidence that LSF can significantly impact the photosynthetic carbon uptake of trees. If trees experience a significant decline in carbon assimilation when LSF occurs, available carbon reserves might be insufficient to fulfil the energetic and osmotic requirements to support the growth of buds and leaves 22 , 23 , 33 . Consequently, trees may adopt a conservative strategy to reduce and avoid the risk of frost damage, resulting in longer periods of deep physiological dormancy and ecodormancy. When LSF occurs, ending the prolonged and deep dormancy period requires greater accumulations of chilling units, forcing units or both to compensate for the carbon loss, ultimately leading to a delayed spring leaf-out in the following year. Therefore, LSF in a given year may delay spring phenology in the following year by altering the accumulation of chilling and forcing units required for trees to break dormancy. To provide explanations for the delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year due to frost-induced carbon reduction, therefore, we proposed three hypotheses: the reduced carbon uptake would lead to an increase in the requirements of (1) chilling units, (2) forcing units or (3) both chilling and forcing units to trigger the onset of spring phenology. To test these hypotheses, we modified a series of process-based phenological models by incorporating the effect of frost-induced decrease in carbon assimilation on spring phenology. We observed that the modified process-based phenology model, with adjustments applied solely in the forcing phase, showed superior performance compared to other models. This finding suggests that, to supplement carbon loss, trees might require higher forcing units as an additional energy source to trigger the onset of spring leaf-out. This trade-off between carbon uptake and forcing units well explains the observed delay in spring phenology in the subsequent year when LSF occurred. By integrating various complementary data sources and conducting an additional frost-controlled experiment, our study provides compelling evidence that LSF can significantly postpone spring phenology in the following year by decreasing photosynthetic carbon assimilation in the current year. Projected LSF effect on spring phenology The global average temperature is projected to rise by around 2 to 4 °C within this century, increasing the risk of LSF 34 . However, we found that CMIP6 models underestimate the effect of LSF on spring phenology under future climate warming. Although the impact of LSF on vegetation growth has recently been incorporated into dynamic global vegetation models 35 , 36 , 37 , the phenological response to frost events is not yet coupled in Earth system models (ESMs). Therefore, ESMs have limitations in accurately depicting extreme events and their impacts on vegetation phenology. Owing to the absence of intricate interactions between carbon uptake and spring phenology, traditional ESMs fail to detect and even underestimate the delaying effect induced by LSF 38 . In contrast, our modified phenology model incorporates the impact of LSF-induced carbon loss, significantly enhancing the simulation of projected delays in spring phenology under future climatic scenarios. By integrating the interactions among LSF, carbon assimilation and spring phenology, our modified phenology model offers a new and comprehensive framework for understanding and predicting changes in spring phenology and terrestrial carbon cycling in a warming world. Variations among tree species and regions We observed that the magnitude of the delayed effect of LSF in the current year on spring phenology in the next year varied among different tree species and regions. Specifically, spring phenology of broadleaf tree species was delayed more than that of conifer tree species. It is reported that thick and narrow needles in conifers are often more resistant to extreme climate conditions, such as frost and drought, compared to wide and flat leaves in broadleaf trees 39 , 40 . Broadleaf tree species are therefore more vulnerable to frost damage compared to conifer tree species. In addition, conifer trees carry multiple generations of needles and old needles could compensate for photosynthesis once new needles are damaged by frost 41 . The clade-specific foliar traits may explain why spring phenology in conifers is less sensitive to frost than it is in broadleaved trees. Early-leafing species often exhibit an ‘opportunistic’ strategy to maximize photosynthetic carbon assimilation despite the risk of frost damage, compared to late-leafing species that are more sensitive to photoperiod 16 , 42 , 43 . We observed that spring phenology of late-leafing species in the next year was delayed more than that of early-leafing species when LSF occurred. Generally, species in which leaf emergence occurred earlier experience a higher risk of frost damage compared to late-leafing species. Therefore, early-leafing species might have evolved a higher frost resistance to reduce the damage when LSF occurred. To test this hypothesis, we further examined the relationship between frost resistance, indicated by the LT 50 and the timings of leaf-out in eight widely distributed temperate broadleaf tree species. Our results indicated that species with earlier leaf-out had a significantly stronger frost resistance than those with later leaf-out. Moreover, frost-induced delayed days of spring phenology showed a significant decrease with an increase in frost resistance. Therefore, species-specific frost resistance well explains why the early-leafing species are less sensitive to frost compared to the late-leafing species. Combining long-term and large-scale ground-based phenological records across the Northern Hemisphere, we found that LSF significantly delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year by reducing photosynthetic carbon assimilation. This conclusion was further reinforced by the evidence gathered from our frost-controlled experiment and the simulations of process-based phenology models. We further observed a significant decrease in GPP in the subsequent year due to the frost-induced delay in spring phenology, indicating the feedback effect of frost-induced delay in spring phenology on GPP. Our results reveal complex interactions between spring-frost risk, phenology and terrestrial carbon cycling. In light of the increasing risk of LSF, it is crucial to integrate our findings into ESMs to ensure accurate projections of the impact of climate extremes on terrestrial carbon cycling under future climate change, which can further inform decision-making regarding the ecological and economic impacts of these frost events on land management, forestry and agriculture. Methods Phenological data Ground-based phenology network The SOS was obtained from the Pan European Phenology Network (PEP725), USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), China Phenological Observation Network (CPON) and Russian ‘Chronicles of Nature’ Network (RCNN). The PEP725 contains in situ phenological observations of many temperate species across central Europe since 1868 44 , The USA-NPN includes plant phenological records of 400 species at 3,000 sites in conterminous United States 45 . The CPON involves phenological data at 44 sites in China starting in 1963 46 . The RCNN has 506,186 phenological observations at 471 sites in Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan 47 . Owing to the different definitions of spring phenological events for each ground-based network, we screened the phenological observations of all four ground phenological network according to distinct criteria (Supplementary Note 1 ). PhenoCam network PhenoCam network ( https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/ ) is a cooperative continental-scale repository. The network uses digital phenocamera imagery to track the timing of phenological transition from 2000 to 2018 in North America and around the world 48 . In the PhenoCam network, the 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of the green chromatic cordinate ( G CC ) were calculated to extract the date of greenness rising and falling using the following formula: $${{G}}_{\rm{CC}}=\frac{{{G}}_{\rm{DN}}}{{{R}}_{\rm{DN}}+{{G}}_{\rm{DN}}+{{B}}_{\rm{DN}}}$$ (1) where R DN , G DN and B DN denotes the average digital numbers (DN) of red, green and blue colour channels across the region of interest, respectively. We used the 50% threshold of 90th percentile G CC as spring leaf-out 49 . We removed outliers more than 2.5 times of median absolute deviation (MAD) 50 . We obtained three forest types: evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous needleleaf forests and deciduous broadleaf forests. Ultimately, we selected 529 records at 67 sites with at least 5 years of observations between 2000 and 2018. GIMMS NDVI3g phenological product Over recent decades, satellite remote-sensing data have been widely used to detect long-term and large-scale plant phenological events 51 . We derived SOS metrics from the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset ( https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NASA/.ARC/.ECOCAST/ ) produced by advanced very high resolution radiometer instruments between 1982 and 2014 at 0.08° spatial resolution and 15 day temporal resolution 52 . We excluded non-vegetated areas with annual average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of <0.1 to reduce bias. We used Savitzky–Golay filter to smooth the time series and minimize the noise of atmospheric interference and satellite sensor before the estimation of spring phenology 53 . We then applied a double logistic function (equation ( 2 )) to fit annual NDVI time-series curve and calculated the second-order derivative of the fitted curve 51 . The SOS was defined as the date when the rate of change in curvature reached its first local maximum value in the first half year. $$y(t)=a+b\,\left(\frac{1}{1+{e}^{c(t-d)}}+\frac{1}{1+{e}^{e(t-f\;)}}\right)$$ (2) where b , c , d and f are parameters of logistic function and a is the initial background NDVI value, a + b denotes the maximum NDVI value, t is time in days and y ( t ) is the NDVI value at time t . MODIS phenological product The MODIS land surface phenology product (MCD12Q2 V6) was downloaded from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center ( https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/ ) 54 . The MCD12Q2 product provides annual characteristics of vegetation phenology at a spatial resolution of 500 m between 2001 and 2019 on a global scale. The phenological metrics were derived from time series of the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), which is calculated from MODIS nadir BRDF adjusted surface reflectance (NBAR-EVI2). We selected the ‘greenup’ phase to define SOS and to represent spring leaf-out. The SOS was defined as the date when the EVI2 first crossed 15% of the segment EVI2 amplitude. Future phenological data Owing to the absence of future NDVI and EVI data, we extracted phenological metrics using daily GPP and LAI datasets to predict future phenology shifts at the end of this century (2080–2100) under four climatic scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). GPP and LAI data for the period 2080–2100 were obtained from the NorESM2-MM model at 1° spatial resolution, which is a component of the CMIP6 ( https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/ ). We first used Savitzky–Golay filter to smooth the time series and exclude abnormal daily GPP (or LAI) values before estimating spring phenology 53 . We then applied a double logistic function (equation ( 2 )) to fit annual GPP (or LAI) time series and extracted SOS 51 , which is defined as the date when the rate of change in curvature reached its first local maximum value in the first half year. GPP and NPP data The annual GPP and NPP datasets between 1982 and 2018 were obtained from the global land surface satellite (GLASS) product ( http://www.glass.umd.edu/index.html ) at 0.05° spatial resolution 55 . Remote-sensing vegetation indices We used two complementary remote-sensing vegetation indices, the NDVI and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), to quantify the impact of LSF on tree growth. NDVI and EVI data from 2001 to 2019 were derived from Terra MODIS vegetation indices products (MOD13A1) at 500 m spatial resolution and 16 day temporal resolution. Tree-ring width data We also used raw tree-ring width (TRW) and basal area increment (BAI) to examine the effect of LSF on tree growth and productivity 56 . TRW data were obtained from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) database and ref. 57 . In total, we retained 35,716 TRW records of 66 tree species at 1,855 sites with at least 15 years of observations during 1982–2014 in the Northern Hemisphere. BAI, a two-dimensional measure, provides a more accurate quantification of wood production compared to TRW 58 . Owing to the lack of field-measured diameters in the ITRDB database, we calculated diameters from the sum of annual raw TRWs in accordance with previous studies 59 , 60 . The BAI of each tree-ring core was calculated using equation ( 3 ). $${\rm{BAI}}=\pi\,\left({{R}}_{t}^{2}-{{R}}_{t-1}^{2}\right)$$ (3) where R denotes the radius and t represents the year of tree-ring formation. MODIS land cover product The MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1) with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification scheme at 500 m spatial resolution was used to define the vegetation types 61 . The IGBP classification scheme includes 17 land cover types. We excluded non-forest vegetation types and reclassified the original forest types into the needleleaf forests, broadleaf forests, mixed forests and woody savannas. Global climate zones product The global ecological zone (GEZ) of the forest resources assessment with a spatial resolution of 0.05° was used to define the climate zones 62 . We only kept areas outside the tropics (latitudes >30° N) that have clear seasonal phenological cycles and classified forest biomes into subtropical forests, temperate forests and boreal forests based on the GEZ 2010 map. Climate data Gridded daily minimum temperature during 1950–2013 in Europe were obtained from the database E-OBS ( http://www.ecad.eu/ ) with 0.25° spatial resolution to match the PEP725 phenological dataset. We also used global daily minimum and average temperatures during 1950–2020 from the CRU JRA v.2.2 dataset at 0.5° spatial resolution to match other phenological datasets. Monthly standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) data between 1982 and 2019 were extracted from the global 0.5° gridded SPEI dataset (SPEIbase v.2.9) ( http://hdl.handle.net/10261/332007 ). Monthly Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) data from 1982 to 2019 were derived from TerraClimate dataset at 4 km spatial resolution 63 . Future daily minimum and average temperatures during 2080–2100 were obtained from the CMIP6 model (NorESM2-MM) under four climatic scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) with 1° spatial resolution. To address the difference in the spatial resolutions of various remote-sensing datasets, all satellite remote-sensing datasets were resampled to 0.25° spatial resolution. Then, the bilinear interpolation method was used to extract climate data for each site or pixel using the raster package 64 in R 65 . Spring phenology models We used four process-based phenology models to simulate and predict spring phenology, including one-phase growing degree days model (GDD) 66 , spring warming model (SW) 67 , two-phase sequential model (SM) 68 and parallel model (PM) 69 (Supplementary Note 2 ). Statistical analysis We first investigated the carry-over effect of LSF on spring phenology using five ground-based phenological and PhenoCam networks and remotely sensed data from 1950 to 2020 in the Northern Hemisphere. To clarify the frost-induced changes in spring phenology, we then examined the effect of LSF on photosynthetic productivity using remote-sensing data (GPP and NPP) and frost-controlled growth chamber experiments. To test the robustness of our results, we also quantified the impact of LSF on tree growth and productivity using remote-sensing vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) and tree-ring width (TRW and BAI) in the Northern Hemisphere. Considering that GPP and NPP data are more closely connected to the growth of leaves and canopies compared to tree-ring width records, GPP and NPP data were further used to examine the effect of LSF on photosynthetic productivity in the next year. Lastly, we projected the effect of LSF on spring phenology based on CMIP6 models and modified SM under four future climatic scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Effect of LSF on spring phenology Previous studies showed that spring temperatures below −2 °C may significantly affect the growth and survival of trees 5 , 10 . Here we defined the LSF event as the last frost event (when daily minimum temperature falls below −2 °C) that occurred between the period after SOS and before 15 July 7 . To examine the carry-over effect of LSF on spring phenology in the next year, we calculated and compared the changes in SOS of the next year (SOS next ) at each site or pixel using multisource observational data when LSF occurred or did not (ground phenological network, PhenoCam network and satellite remote-sensing products) across the Northern Hemisphere. To this end, we first calculated the difference in SOS (∆SOS) for each consecutive 2 year period according to equation ( 4 ). Then, we identified whether LSF occurred at each site (pixel) in each year and compared the difference of ∆SOS when LSF occurred or not. $$\Delta {\rm{SOS}}={{\rm{DOY}}}_{t+1}-{{\rm{DOY}}}_{t}$$ (4) where the DOY t is the timing of SOS in year t and DOY t +1 is the timing of SOS in the next year t + 1. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the difference in the ∆SOS when LSF occurred or not for each phenological dataset. Using linear mixed model, we further examined the overall effect of LSF on SOS next by pooling all the ground-based phenological datasets for a global test. In the model, the response variable was ∆SOS, the fixed effect was the occurrence of LSF, with random intercepts among sites and species. To eliminate the influence of low preseason temperatures on spring phenology, we categorized preseasons into either cold or warm based on whether the mean minimum temperature during winter (November to January), spring (February to April) and the combined winter and spring months (November to April) of the specific year at the particular site fell below or above their long-term averages from 1982 to 2018, respectively. We used one-way ANOVA to assess the variation in ∆SOS when LSF occurred or did not occur during cold and warm preseasons. To test the robustness of our results, we further examined the effects of both spring temperature and LSF on timing of leaf-out using a linear mixed model. In this model, the response variable is ∆SOS, the predictors are the occurrence of LSF (a categorical variable with two levels: occurrence and non-occurrence) and the differences in spring temperature, with species and sites are set as random effects. To address the species-specific frost response, we divided the tree species into early-leafing species and late-leafing species on the basis of the mean SOS date of all species in each ground-based phenological dataset. One-way ANOVA was used to test the difference in the ∆SOS between early- and late-leafing species and between broadleaf and conifer species using ground-based phenological data, also among different forest types and climate zones using remote-sensing and ground-based phenological datasets. We also set the minimum temperature threshold of LSF at 0 °C, −2 °C and −4 °C to examine and compare the carry-over effect of different levels of LSF on spring phenology in the next year in eight deciduous tree species based on the PEP725 dataset, the largest ground phenological network used in our study. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we further incorporated the temporal dimension of frost damage into the LSF definition. Specifically, we redefined LSF to be the period from 1 to 8 weeks after SOS and before 15 July, using a range of temperature thresholds (0, −2 and −4 °C) based on ground phenological networks. Using a 1 week smoothing window, we re-examined carry-over effect of LSF on spring phenology based on ground-based phenological data. The accumulation of thermal units before the LSF potentially increases the susceptibility of immature leaves to sub-zero temperatures. Using the smoothing window, we also calculated the accumulated GDD exceeding 0 °C from 1 January to the occurrence of LSF for assessing the temporal change in LSF risk 16 . Estimates of the lethal temperature Among all the ground-based phenological networks, the period of phenological records in the PEP725 spanned nearly six decades and was distributed at more than 1,000 sites. To ensure the robustness of results, the long-term and large-scale SOS records from the PEP725 network were selected to calculate the lethal temperature of 50% leaves (LT 50 ) to further clarify differences in SOS next in response to LSF among tree species. The LT 50 is commonly determined by electrolyte leakage tests or visual damage assessment in the field or in the laboratory 70 , 71 . We conducted an extensive literature search and compiled LT 50 in as many tree species as possible in the PEP725 dataset. Since LT 50 is greatly affected by the leaf development stage, we only retained LT 50 measured in spring leaf-out 5 , 7 . Ultimately, we obtained determined LT 50 values in five tree species. Also, we used a four-parameter logistic model with two fixed asymptotes and two free parameters to estimate the LT 50 of all eight selected temperate species in the PEP725 dataset (equation ( 5 )) 72 . Specifically, we used two asymptotes to limit the estimate below −1 °C, which corresponds to the highest LT 50 of woody plants observed in temperate regions 73 and above −7.5 °C, which is close to the lowest measured LT 50 obtained from literature. To ensure reliability, we extracted the median dates of long-term and multisite SOS for each species to estimate the LT 50 . $${{\rm{LT}}}_{50}=\frac{a-b}{1+\exp [(c-x)/d]}+b$$ (5) where a and b are fixed parameters, a = −7.5 and b = −1, c and d are free parameters (estimated c = 130, d = −10) and x is the predictor variable (median date of leaf unfolding for each species). We conducted a nonlinear model fitted using the nlme package 74 in R 65 . Correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the measured and calculated LT 50 values. Linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between the LT 50 predicted by the model and ∆SOS for each species in the PEP725 dataset. Effect of LSF on photosynthetic productivity We first matched GLASS GPP (or NPP) data with GIMMS NDVI3g and MODIS phenological products. We then analysed the changes in the GPP and NPP in the current year (GPP current , NPP current ) when LSF occurred or did not occur for each pixel using remote-sensing data. One-way ANOVA was used to test the difference in the GPP current (or NPP current ) when LSF occurred or not in the current year. We also confirmed the LSF damage using long-term and large-scale remote-sensing vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) and tree-ring data (TRW and BAI) in the Northern Hemisphere. We further used SEM to examine the relationships between LSF, GPP current (or NPP current ) and SOS next using remote-sensing data. We constructed a conceptual model that includes both the direct and indirect effects of LSF in the current year on SOS next . In the SEM model, we hypothesized that LSF in the current year is likely to directly affect the SOS next , indicated by the arrows from LSF directly pointing to the SOS next or indirectly affecting SOS next by altering the photosynthetic carbon assimilation, indicated by the arrows from LSF first directly pointing to GPP current (or NPP current ) then to the SOS next . Incidentally, SOS in the current year (SOS current ) may directly alter carbon storage and then affect SOS next . Therefore, SOS current is also included in SEM as a direct and indirect factor in the model. The piecewise SEM was fit using the piecewiseSEM package 75 in R 65 . To eliminate the potential impact of drought on GPP current , we conducted an analysis of GPP current changes concerning the occurrence or absence of summer droughts (between July and September) in the current year, using both 6- and 12-month SPEI data as well as PDSI data. For our analysis, a summer drought event was defined as when the mean SPEI dropped below −2 or when the mean PDSI fell below −4 during the summer months. We used one-way ANOVA to assess the disparity in ∆GPP current between instances where LSF occurred or did not occur in the current year. Using a frost-controlled experiment with four tree species widely distributed in temperate and subtropical forests (Supplementary Note 3 ), we further investigated the effect of LSF on photosynthetic rate and NSC of stem and leaves to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between LSF and photosynthetic productivity. We also calculated species-specific shifts in photosynthetic rate, starch, soluble sugar and total NSC between the control (CK) and LSF groups. we used one-way ANOVA to analyse the differences in photosynthetic rate, starch, soluble sugar and total NSC between the CK and LSF treatment, Feedback effect of spring phenology on photosynthetic productivity To evaluate whether LSFs have an effect on carbon uptake in the subsequent year, one-way ANOVAs were used to examine the differences in the GPP (or NPP) of the subsequent year (GPP next , NPP next ) when LSF occurred and did not. To decipher the interactions between LSF, SOS and GPP, we further calculated and compared the differences in the GPP next and NPP next anomaly (∆GPP next , ∆NPP next ) relative to the long-term average when SOS next was advanced or delayed compared to SOS current for each pixel. One-way ANOVA was used to test the difference in ∆GPP next (or ∆NPP next ) when SOS next was advanced and delayed. Projected effect of LSF on spring phenology under future climatic scenarios We similarly used daily minimum temperature (below −2 °C) to define LSF during 2080–2100 from the CMIP6 models under four climatic scenarios. We then used daily GPP data to extract future phenological metrics and examined the effect of LSF on spring phenology based on CMIP6 models under four future climatic scenarios. Owing to the superior performance of the modified SM, with solely the adjusted forcing phase, in simulating spring phenology when considering frost-induced reduction in photosynthetic productivity, the modified SM was further used to predict the potential effects of LSF on shifts in spring phenology under future climatic scenario. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test was used to test the difference in mean ∆SOS when LSF occurred or not for different climatic scenarios using modified SM and original CMIP6 models. To minimize the uncertainties arising from single phenological data, we also performed the same analysis to investigate effect of LSF on spring phenology using daily LAI data from CMIP6 models under four future climatic scenarios. We further assessed the temporal change in the carry-over effect of LSF and its risk using ground phenological networks. All data analyses were conducted using R v.4.1.1 (ref. 65 ).
