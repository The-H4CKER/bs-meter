Main Populations of many insect species have been decimated by climate change, leading to substantial reductions in insect diversity 1 , 2 . In some species, however, climate change has driven increases in population sizes 3 ; populations of tree-girdling bark beetles, for example, have increased because of the lengthened growing seasons that result from increased temperatures 4 , leading to sharp increases in tree mortality 5 . Negative effects of climate change on insects in general do not preclude positive effects of climate change on forest pest insects in particular. Forest-defoliating insects also damage forests; of 83 non-native pests for which the US Forest Service has reported damage, 34% are defoliators 6 . The damage that defoliators inflict on forests may cause meaningful reductions in the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks 7 , but the extent to which defoliators are affected by climate change is not well understood 8 , making it difficult to project the effects of forest defoliators on carbon budgets. Climate anomalies temporarily reduced outbreak severity in the larch budmoth, Zeiraphera diniana 9 , and appear to have altered cycles of the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria 10 . A complicating factor, however, is that specialist pathogens and parasitoids, whether naturally occurring or introduced, typically play a key role in suppressing defoliator populations 11 , including in the larch budmoth 12 and the forest tent caterpillar 13 . To project how climate change will affect forest defoliators and the forests that they defoliate, we must project the effects of climate change on interactions between forest trees, forest defoliators, and the pathogens and parasitoids of forest defoliators. Here we project the effects of climate change on the interaction between North American hardwood trees, the defoliating spongy moth Lymantria dispar and the spongy moth’s fatal, specialist, fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga . For decades after its accidental introduction into North America in 1869, the spongy moth caused millions of US dollars in damage each year 14 , until the advent of E. maimaiga in 1989 began a period of low spongy moth defoliation 15 and high E. maimaiga infection rates 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 that lasted for 27 years. (It is unclear if the first widespread observations of E. maimaiga infections in 1989 were due to an accidental introduction in that year, or to intentional introductions in earlier years that appeared to have failed but that may have created hidden reservoirs of the pathogen 25 .) Like many fungal pathogens 26 , however, E. maimaiga spreads more rapidly when conditions are cool and moist 27 , and so the hot, relatively dry conditions that climate change is bringing to the insect’s range in eastern North America 28 may lead to the resurgence of the spongy moth. A range-change model has indeed projected that climate change will allow the spongy moth to invade areas that are beyond the northern edge of its range 29 , potentially leading to defoliation in locations with no previous history of spongy moth infestation. Notably, however, the model in question only considered the effects of climate change on spongy moth growth rates, whereas defoliation depends on spongy moth densities 30 , which are in turn strongly affected by E. maimaiga densities. Projecting the effects of climate change on defoliation rates required us to construct a model that could project the densities of both the spongy moth and E. maimaiga . Constructing an eco-climate model Ecological models of species interactions, such as the spongy moth– E. maimaiga interaction, are expressly designed to project future densities of interacting species 31 , but are rarely used because of their high data requirements 32 . In previous work, however, three of us and colleagues collected an extensive data set on the effects of weather on E. maimaiga epizootics (epidemics in animals) in spongy moth populations in the lower peninsula of Michigan, USA, and we used model selection to choose the model that best described our data from a group of 15 plausible ecological models 23 . The best model ( Methods and Supplementary Information Section 1 ) consists of a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-removed or ‘SEIR’ model from theoretical epidemiology 33 that we modified to allow for stochasticity and for the effects of weather on the pathogen’s overwintering ‘resting spores’, which initiate epizootics, and airborne ‘conidia’, which sustain epizootics. The model uses information on weather and initial spongy moth and resting spore densities as inputs to project E. maimaiga infection rates. Because the model explicitly accounts for ecological mechanisms, it allows for a clearer understanding of how the effects of climate change on the spongy moth– E. maimaiga interaction are translated into changes in spongy moth defoliation rates 34 , and may provide more accurate projections than phenomenological statistical models 35 . Because we used model selection to choose from a large number of variant models 23 , and because the best model can reproduce literature data collected far from our Michigan study sites (Supplementary Information Section 1.5.2 ), we have a high degree of confidence in the model’s projections (see Supplementary Information Section 1.4 for additional tests of the model). Here we use the model to project the effects of climate change on E. maimaiga infection rates across the North American range of the spongy moth. Our climate change model incorporates a technique known as ‘dynamic down-scaling’, in which continental scale projections from standard climate change models, in our case the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4, with bias correction measures; see Methods and Supplementary Information Section 2 ), provide the external forcing boundaries for the small-scale projections of a regional model, in our case the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model 28 , 36 . The WRF model makes projections at a scale of 12 km, thereby approximating the forest scales at which E. maimaiga epizootics occur. Simulations of our climate change model project that temperatures will increase and relative humidity will decrease at the vast majority of locations in eastern North America, but the simulations also project that rainfall will increase at almost as many locations as it will decrease (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: Projected relative changes in weather variables due to climate change for RCP 8.5 scenario. We averaged the weather variables during epizootics at each location separately for the years 1995–2004 (historical) and 2085–2094 (future) to produce an average for each period, and we calculated the relative difference between the future and historical averages. Defining S i ,h and S i ,f as historical and future values, respectively, relative per cent change at location i is 100% × ( S i ,f − S i ,h )/ S i ,h . Histograms show distributions across locations. Black lines show means; red lines show 5th/95th percentiles. Mean absolute changes: rainfall −0.13 mm d −1 , relative humidity 2.43%, temperature +0.34 °C. Relative humidity measures moisture that the atmosphere contains relative to what it can contain; because the amount that the atmosphere can contain rises with temperature, increases in temperature can reduce relative humidity even if rainfall increases 48 . Pct., percentage. Full size image Our climate change model’s projections are important because increased temperature and reduced relative humidity have negative effects on E. maimaiga infection rates, whereas increased rainfall has positive effects on E. maimaiga infection rates 23 . Because at many locations changes in temperature and relative humidity and changes in rainfall will have opposite effects, we cannot easily intuit the effects of climate change on E. maimaiga using our climate change model alone. To understand the net effects of climate change on E. maimaiga , we combined our ecological model with our climate change model to form what we call an ‘eco-climate’ model. (The code that we used to generate projections from our eco-climate model is available on GitHub; see Code availability sections for the link.) Projecting the effects of climate change Despite the complex spatial variation in the projections of our climate change model, our eco-climate model projects that E. maimaiga infection rates will be reduced almost everywhere in the range of the spongy moth (Fig. 2 ). Moreover, although E. maimaiga infection rates increase sharply with spongy moth densities both in nature and in our model 23 , the model projects that reductions in infection rates will occur at a wide range of spongy moth densities. Fig. 2: Eco-climate model projections of relative per cent changes in E. maimaiga infection. At each location in each year, we averaged the fraction infected over 100 realizations. We then averaged the value at each location separately for the years 1995–2004 and 2085–2094 to produce an average for each period, and we calculated the relative difference between the future and historical averages. Initial insect densities are in units of spongy moth egg masses per hectare, which we multiplied by 250 eggs per egg mass, a typical egg mass size 37 , to produce initial larval densities. Histograms are as in Fig. 1 , with red vertical lines representing changes of 0%. Full size image Reductions in infection rates are nevertheless projected to be the most severe at low and intermediate spongy moth densities (≤2,000 egg masses ha −1 ; Fig. 3 ). This result is concerning because the hundreds of eggs produced by each female spongy moth can turn low- and intermediate-density populations into outbreaking populations (≥10, 000 egg masses ha −1 ) within a few generations 37 . High E. maimaiga infection rates at low and intermediate densities therefore played a crucial role in preventing large-scale spongy moth outbreaks for 27 years 20 . Our model’s projections imply that the negative effects of climate change on E. maimaiga may again allow the spongy moth to severely defoliate North American forests. Fig. 3: Summary of eco-climate model projections. Top scenario is based on Figs. 2 and 4 , while other scenarios are based on maps from Extended Data Figs. 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 (see Supplementary Information Section 6 ). The fraction infected is projected to fall while defoliation is projected to rise, so for ease of visualization we multiplied the change in the fraction infected by −1. Light green lines show mean fractions infected across 3,080 locations, with values at each location averaged across 100 realizations of 10 historical or future years. Dark green lines show 5th/95th percentiles across locations. Small negative values at low densities indicate that the fraction infected is projected to increase at a small fraction of locations. Pink dashed lines show mean defoliation. Purple dashed lines show 5th/95th percentiles across locations. Full size image At high spongy moth densities, reductions in the E. maimaiga infection rate are projected to be more modest because the negative effects of climate change on the infection rate will be partly counter-balanced by the positive effects of high spongy moth densities. There is nevertheless a range of intermediate to high densities at which E. maimaiga epizootics have often occurred and at which reductions in the infection rate are projected to be more moderate, but at which increases in defoliation are projected to be high (1,000–10,000 egg masses ha −1 ; Fig. 4 ). This effect occurs because defoliation rates rise very rapidly with spongy moth densities, so that even modest reductions in the infection rate at intermediate to high densities can lead to sharp increases in defoliation. Fig. 4: Model projections of changes in defoliation due to climate change. Defoliation rates were calculated using a parameterized Weibull function from the literature 30 (Supplementary Information Section 4 ). Defoliation is based on post-epizootic densities and is averaged over 100 realizations. As in Fig. 2 , we averaged separately for 1995–2004 and 2085–2094, and we calculated the difference between the two averages. At high density, our model (accurately) projects very high E. maimaiga infection rates pre-climate change 23 , leading to very low post-epizootic defoliation rates; to avoid extreme projections of changes in defoliation, we plotted absolute differences instead of relative differences. Full size image Although here we report mean outcomes across 100 stochastic model realizations, outcomes at the upper 75th percentile are much more severe than the outcomes at the mean, while outcomes at the lower 25th percentile are only moderately less severe than the outcomes at the mean (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information Section 5 ). Our conclusion that climate change will generally lead to decreased E. maimaiga infection rates, and consequently to increased defoliation, is thus conservative. The range of spongy moth densities across which we have made projections includes the entire range of densities at which E. maimaiga epizootics 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 and spongy moth populations have been observed in the past 37 . Our model therefore projects that climate change will reduce E. maimaiga infection rates across the spongy moth’s entire North American range and entire range of population densities. Meanwhile, the repeated occurrence of spongy moth outbreaks in the pre- E. maimaiga era means that mortality due to other natural enemies, whether generalist small mammal predators or the spongy moth’s baculovirus pathogen 11 , is unlikely to compensate for the decline of E. maimaiga . Alternative scenarios To emphasize the seriousness of the situation, so far we have only considered the effects of climate change near the end of the century, specifically the period 2085–2094, under the relatively pessimistic Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario of carbon dioxide concentrations. Although weather changes by 2045–2054 are projected to be moderately less severe than by 2085–2094 (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information Section 6.1 ), the sensitivity of the spongy moth– E. maimaiga interaction to weather means that reductions in the infection rate by the middle of the century will be almost as severe and almost as geographically widespread as by the end of the century (Fig. 3 ). Although the frequency of sites that will experience increases will be moderately higher than at the end of the century, the increases will be small and will be restricted to a small fraction of the landscape, while decreases and associated increases in defoliation will be almost as severe as the decreases and increases projected to occur by the end of the century (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4 and Supplementary Information Section 6.1 ). The mid-century scenario is thus similar to the end-of-century scenario. The RCP 4.5 climate change scenario leads to moderately less severe changes than the RCP 8.5 scenario, as expected (Fig. 3 ; see Extended Data Figs. 5 – 7 for associated maps and Supplementary Information Section 6.2 for details). The distribution of changes across the landscape under the RCP 4.5 scenario, however, differs in complex ways from the distribution under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Partly as a result, at the lowest spongy moth densities the reductions in infection rates are slightly stronger than under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Because of the important role that E. maimaiga epizootics at low spongy moth densities play in suppressing outbreaks, climate change may increase spongy moth defoliation more under the RCP 4.5 scenario than under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The differences in the two cases are modest, however, and so we conclude that our results are robust to changes in the CO 2 concentration scenario. The importance of species interactions The spongy moth– E. maimaiga interaction is incorporated into our model through the model’s transmission rate. Because the transmission rate is proportional to the product of the density of E. maimaiga spores and the density of spongy moths, it is density-dependent and nonlinear. Because transmission is nonlinear, and because the model is weather-dependent, small changes in weather can drive large changes in E. maimaiga infection rates. To better understand this effect, we constructed a weather-only model that includes effects of weather but not density-dependent transmission. The weather-only model projects that climate change will have only mild effects on the E. maimaiga infection rate (Fig. 5 ). Because the weather-only model provided a much worse fit to our epizootic data than our best model 23 , and because previous efforts to use weather data alone to explain epizootics 38 similarly achieved only moderate success, we conclude that density-dependent transmission plays a key role in modulating the effects of climate change on E. maimaiga . The optimistic projections of the weather-only model demonstrate that a consideration of species interactions is crucial for projecting the ecological consequences of climate change. Fig. 5: Changes in the fraction infected as projected by the weather-only model. As in Fig. 2 , here changes are averaged across realizations and years, and within periods. Because the E. maimaiga –spongy moth interaction is not included in this model, host density has no effect on the model projections, and so we did not vary host density. Full size image Our eco-climate model further assumes that spongy moth larval growth increases linearly with temperature and that there is no non-disease larval mortality due to high temperatures. (As we explain in Supplementary Information Section 1.3.1 , the model implicitly allows for losses that occur when larvae disperse from their egg masses to foliage, which is the most important source of non-disease mortality in the spongy moth 39 .) Although the model provided a good fit to E. maimaiga data in our previous work 23 , future temperatures will be higher than they were when we collected our data. Larval mortality due to high future temperatures may reduce spongy moth population growth rates, mitigating the effects of reductions in E. maimaiga infection rates. To test for this possibility, we used literature data to extend our eco-climate model to allow for negative effects of high temperatures on larval growth and survival. The extended model gives results that are indistinguishable from the results of the original model (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Information Section 6.4.2 ). The two sets of projections are similar first because future increases in temperature are unlikely to be high enough to have much effect on larval growth and survival. Also, spongy moth larvae hatch in the spring, and so high temperatures primarily affect late-stage larvae, whereas epizootic severity is determined by conditions among intermediate-stage larvae 23 . Reductions in spongy moth densities due to the temperature-driven deaths of late-stage larvae are unlikely to have much effect on E. maimaiga infection rates, which typically dwarf post-dispersal non-disease mortality 23 . Climate change-driven increases in larval growth are also unlikely to have much effect on epizootic length (Supplementary Information Section 7 ). The ecological effects of climate change on the spongy moth– E. maimaiga interaction are likely to have a bigger effect on spongy moth defoliation than the physiological effects of climate change on the spongy moth alone. Recent data are consistent with model projections Region-wide spongy moth outbreaks occurred in New England in 2015–2018 and in Ontario in 2019–2021 for the first time since the introduction of E. maimaiga 29 , 40 (Fig. 6 ; see Supplementary Information Section 8.1 for associated maps), while an outbreak in Michigan from 2019 to 2024 was the worst since the introduction of the spongy moth into the state in the 1980s. These outbreaks were associated with hot, dry weather 40 , consistent with our results. Although the recent outbreaks have all collapsed, their rise and fall was typical of pre- E. maimaiga –spongy moth outbreaks, when defoliation was often severe. Fig. 6: Area defoliated since the widespread introduction of E. maimaiga 49 . The data represent the sum of spongy moth defoliated forest area in the United States and Ontario, Canada. See Methods for data sources. Full size image In southwest Michigan in particular, spongy moth densities in 2024 were 1.5–1.75 times higher than any density reported in North America since the introduction of E. maimaiga , while E. maimaiga infection rates in the same area in 2021, 2023 and 2024 were far lower than in 2010–2012 23 (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Information Section 8.2 ). In 2024, the baculovirus caused the collapse of the outbreak, and thus partially compensated for low E. maimaiga infection rates. The baculovirus can only spread when spongy moth densities are very high, however, and so it did not prevent severe defoliation. Because we collected infection-rate data at relatively small spatial scales we can only confirm that E. maimaiga infection rates were low in southwest Michigan, but like the Michigan data the combined US and Ontario data followed a pattern of sharply rising and falling defoliation that was typical of spongy moth outbreaks in the pre- E. maimaiga era (Fig. 6 ). Discussion Our model’s projections are concerning not just because the spongy moth damages economically valuable timber, but also because the spongy moth feeds preferentially on oaks, Quercus spp. The spongy moth has been an important factor driving ‘oak decline’ 14 , the replacement of oaks by maples, Acer spp., in North America 41 . Compared with oaks, maples provide fewer resources for native insects, songbirds and small mammals 42 , and so the effects of climate change on the E. maimaiga –spongy moth interaction provide an important example of how the effects of climate change can radiate through natural communities. Our model’s projections are also relevant to projections of how climate change will affect hardwood forests. Tree growth models project that increasing CO 2 concentrations will fertilize forests 43 , a result supported by forest-level experiments with elevated CO 2 44 , but tree growth models either neglect insects entirely or include insects only as disturbances 7 . Our eco-climate model instead projects that climate change will have negative effects on North American hardwood forests because rising temperatures and falling relative humidity will diminish the ability of E. maimaiga to reduce spongy moth densities. Whether increased spongy moth defoliation will counter-balance the fertilizing effects of CO 2 on hardwood forests, however, is unknown. Extending our ecological species interaction model to include tree demography is an important future direction. An extended model would further allow for a consideration of the effects of climate change on the density of oaks versus other host trees, which can also alter spongy moth defoliation 45 . An extended model would also make it possible to test whether phenological mismatch between spongy moth hatch and tree budburst would be strengthened by climate change, with the proviso that the spongy moth’s use of multiple host trees has been shown to mitigate the effects of phenological mismatch 39 . Finally, although the effects of high temperatures on larvae had little effect on our model’s projections, the effects of high temperatures on pupae and adults may be strong enough to alter population densities 46 , 47 , and may also be worth incorporating into an extended model. More broadly, the observation that larch budmoth defoliation has been reduced by climate change 9 whereas spongy moth defoliation appears to be rising because of climate change suggests that the effects of climate change on forest defoliators may defy simple generalizations. What is needed are studies of the effects of weather and climate change on other forest defoliators, which our work suggests would be aided by close connections between models and data. Eco-climate models like ours have a key role to play in future efforts to understand the ecological consequences of climate change. Methods Equations of the ecological model The ecological model is an SEIR-type model from theoretical epidemiology that we modified to allow for the effects of weather. The model is described in detail in ref. 23 , but here we provide an overview. E. maimaiga epizootics begin when overwintering resting spores germinate, leading to infected larvae that go on to produce airborne infectious spores that are known as ‘conidia’ 27 . Infected larvae continue to produce conidia until late in the epizootic, when they produce resting spores that overwinter. The model describes the dynamics of the epizootic by tracking the densities of conidia and uninfected and infected larvae. Infected larvae are represented by a series of exposed classes, which together allow for the roughly 8-day delay that occurs between infection and conidia production. Because we also allow for stochastic daily fluctuations in transmission, the model consists of random differential equations that are numerically integrated on a daily time scale. In random differential equations, the stochastic terms are assumed to change at discrete time points 50 , whereas in stochastic differential equations the stochastic terms are assumed to change instantaneously. In our model we assumed that the stochastic terms changed each day. Given these assumptions, the equations of the ecological model are: $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{S}_{\tau }}{{\mathrm{d}}t}=-{\nu }_{R,\tau }{S}_{\tau }{R}_{\tau }-{\nu }_{C,\tau }{S}_{\tau }{C}_{\tau },$$ (1) $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{E}_{\tau ,1}}{{\mathrm{d}}t}={\nu }_{R,\tau }{S}_{\tau }{R}_{\tau }+{\nu }_{C,\tau }{S}_{\tau }{C}_{\tau }-m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,1},$$ (2) $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{E}_{\tau ,\,j}}{{\mathrm{d}}t}=m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,\,j-1}-m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,\,j},j=2,\ldots ,m.$$ (3) $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{C}_{\tau }}{{\mathrm{d}}t}=m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,m}-{\mu }_{C,\tau }{C}_{\tau }.$$ (4) Here, τ indicates the day during the epizootic, so that S τ , R τ , E τ , j and C τ are the densities of susceptible hosts, resting spores, exposed larvae in class j and conidia on day τ , respectively. The symbol m represents the number of exposed classes, while λ is the rate at which hosts move between exposed classes (see Supplementary Information Section 1 ). We then integrate from time t = 0 to time t = 1 on each day τ , with the initial value of each state variable set equal to its value at the end of the preceding day. On day τ , the conidia decay rate μ C , τ and the transmission rates ν R , τ for resting spores R τ , and ν C , τ for conidia C τ are determined by stochasticity and by the weather projected for that day by our climate change model 28 . Larval infection risk increases as larvae increase in size, an effect that is determined by the number of degree-days that have accumulated since the start of the epizootic. To incorporate weather into the model, we used information from the literature to construct functions that determine how conidia transmission ν C , τ , resting spore transmission ν R , τ and conidia decay μ C , τ depend on weather. In our previous work 23 , we fitted the parameters of each of these functions to our epizootic data, using our daily measurements of temperature, relative humidity and rainfall as covariates 23 . The resting spore transmission function is a saturating function of accumulated daily rainfall over the previous 10 days p ( τ ), and it allows for larval size in terms of degree-days accumulated up to day τ , D ( τ ): $${\nu }_{R,\tau }=D(\tau )\left(\frac{{\psi }_{1}}{1+{\psi }_{2}\exp (-{\psi }_{3}p(\tau ))}-\frac{{\psi }_{1}}{{\psi }_{2}+1}\right)\exp ({\epsilon }_{R,\tau }).$$ (5) This function was constructed to ensure that resting spore transmission is zero when rainfall p ( τ ) = 0. In our previous work we estimated the parameters ψ 1 , ψ 2 and ψ 3 from the data, along with the standard deviation σ R of the normally distributed, zero-mean stochastic term ϵ R , τ 23 . The conidia transmission function ν C , τ increases exponentially with minimum daily relative humidity m ( τ ); $${\nu }_{C,\tau }=D(\tau ){\psi }_{4}\exp \left({\psi }_{5}m(\tau )\right)\exp ({\epsilon }_{C,\tau }).$$ (6) Here, as in equation ( 5 ), D ( τ ) is accumulated degree-days. The parameters ψ 4 and ψ 5 and the standard deviation σ C of the zero-mean, normally distributed stochastic term ϵ C , τ were all estimated from data in our previous work 23 . Because high temperatures inhibit conidia survival 27 , we assumed that conidia decay μ C , τ is an exponentially increasing function of daily maximum temperature, so that conidia survival falls with temperature: $${\mu }_{C,\tau }={\psi }_{6}\exp \left({\psi }_{7}h(\tau )\right).$$ (7) Here, h ( τ ) is the maximum temperature on day τ , and the parameters ψ 6 and ψ 7 were estimated from the data 23 . To construct the weather-only version of our ecological model, we assumed that E. maimaiga transmission is unaffected by the density of conidia or resting spores. The weather-only model tracks only the density of susceptible larvae S and the density of larvae in exposure class E j , according to: $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{S}_{\tau }}{{\mathrm{d}}t}=-{\nu }_{F,\tau }{S}_{\tau }.$$ (8) $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{E}_{\tau ,1}}{{\mathrm{d}}t}={\nu }_{F,\tau }{S}_{\tau }-m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,1},$$ (9) $$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}{E}_{\tau ,\,j}}{{\mathrm{d}}t}=m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,\,j-1}-m\lambda {E}_{\tau ,\,j},j=2,\ldots ,m.$$ (10) Here, ν F , τ depends on temperature h ( τ ), rainfall p ( τ ) (note that rainfall is again cumulative over the preceding 10 days) and degree-days D ( τ ): $$\begin{array}{rcl}{\nu }_{F,\tau }&=&D(\tau )\left(\frac{{\psi }_{8}}{1+{\psi }_{9}\exp (-{\psi }_{10}p(\tau ))}-\frac{{\psi }_{8}}{{\psi }_{9}+1}\right)\\ &&\times \exp \left(-{\psi }_{11}h(\tau )\exp ({\epsilon }_{F,\tau })\right).\end{array}$$ (11) Because in this model we do not distinguish between transmission from resting spores and transmission from conidia, F stands for fungus, to emphasize that ν F , τ in equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) is distinct from ν R , τ and ν C , τ in equations ( 1 )–( 4 ). As in the rain-dependent transmission function in equation ( 5 ) for the ecological model, the transmission function for the weather-only model ν F , τ is equal to zero when no rain occurs. Here the degree-day function D ( τ ) is the same as in the ecological model. As in the ecological model, the parameters ψ 8 , ψ 9 , ψ 10 , ψ 11 and the standard deviation σ F of the mean-zero stochasticity term ϵ F , τ were estimated from the data in our previous work 23 . Stochasticity ϵ F , τ is here parameterized differently from in the eco-climate model, due to an oversight during the model-fitting process. Re-fitting the full model using the parameterization in equation ( 11 ) confirmed that this difference affects only the scaling of the standard deviation in stochasticity, and thus has no effect on our results. In Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 we provide biological interpretations of our model parameters and estimates of their means and highest posterior densities (the Bayesian equivalent of 95% confidence intervals). In Supplementary Information Section 1.2 we provide more details on our models’ assumptions about how temperature in terms of degree-days affects larval development, which in turn determines larval infection risk and epizootic length. Climate change model The weather projection data that we used in the eco-climate model come from a high-spatial-resolution (12 km) regional climate model, which is based on simulations of the WRF model 28 . The WRF model dynamically downscales projections from a global climate model, the CCSM4, with bias correction measures. For our purposes, the projections from the CCSM4, which have a spatial resolution of around 100 km, serve as the external forcing boundaries for the regional projections of the WRF. In historical simulations the WRF successfully maintains the external forcing from the CCSM4, while providing more realistic spatial details at a much higher resolution. The WRF and the CCSM4 also show similar trends in future projections 28 . The WRF provides improved projection information over the global climate forcing data. Creating maps for locations at risk of defoliation As our projection region includes both the United States and Canada, to draw maps we needed shape files for country, state and province boundaries. For the boundaries of the United States and its states, we obtained data from the R package maps. For Canadian provinces, we downloaded level 1 R(sp) data under version 3.6 from the public map website GADM ( https://gadm.org/data.html ). Making projections at locations that are relevant to the spongy moth was complicated by two problems. First, spongy moth defoliation generally occurs in forests that are dominated by oaks ( Quercus spp.) 37 , but the insect can successfully develop on many host tree genera, and so forest tree species composition is not always a good indicator of which forests will be defoliated. Second, the tree species composition of hardwood forests may be altered by climate change, but it is not clear how soon such alterations will occur 51 , and so accounting for climate change-driven shifts in the location of hardwood forests would seriously complicate our efforts to make projections. We avoided these problems by assuming that locations at which defoliation occurred in the past are likely to be the locations at which defoliation will occur in the future. We then made projections in areas of previous defoliation. To identify areas of previous defoliation, we used two spatially referenced data sets. In the first data set, provided by A. Liebhold of the US Forest Service, defoliation was mapped in the United States from 1975 to 2019 14 . The data from 1975 to 2000 were originally from hand-drawn maps that Liebhold et al. 52 scanned and geo-referenced, while the data from 2001 to 2019 were taken from the FHAAST IDS database compiled by Forest Health Protection, a branch of the US Forest Service ( https://www.fs.usda.gov/science-technology/data-tools-and-products/fhp-mapping-reporting/detection-surveys ). Because the 2001–2019 data are vector-based whereas the 1979–2000 data are rasterized, the 1979–2000 vector-based data were converted by Liebhold to a rasterized format so that we could more easily compare both types of data to our model projections. The second data set, for the province of Ontario, consists of data provided by the provincial government ( https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/documents/lio::forest-insect-damage-event/about ) that include the years 1996–2019. Because at least two spongy moth outbreaks occurred in Ontario before 1996 29 , the Ontario data probably underestimate the area of defoliation in that province. The existing data nevertheless cover a large fraction of southern Ontario (see Supplementary Fig. 8 ), the area in which most hardwood forests in Ontario are found, and so any underestimation in the Ontario data is probably small. Moreover, we are only using the data to indicate approximately where previous defoliation occurred, and so the Ontario data are sufficient for our purposes. Although we made every effort to identify areas within which defoliation has occurred in the past, the data are nevertheless incomplete. Not only do the Ontario data begin in 1996, but we have not been able to locate any publicly available data for Quebec, even though Quebec has experienced at least one spongy moth outbreak 29 . Our maps thus provide a conservative indication of the area of forest that is at risk of increased spongy moth defoliation. To use the defoliation data to guide the construction of our model-projection maps, we needed to ensure that the defoliation data were compatible with our model projections. To do this, we re-projected the spongy moth defoliation data on a latitude/longitude scale in the WGS84 coordinate reference system. We then filtered the model-projection squares according to their proximity to the defoliation-data squares. Because the distance encompassed by a degree of latitude depends on the longitude, ordinary Euclidean distance is not a useful metric for determining the proximity of a model-projection square and a defoliation-data square. As we explain in more detail in Supplementary Information Section 3 , as a measure of proximity we instead used the sum of the absolute difference in latitude and the absolute difference in longitude between each model square and the nearest defoliation square. Through a process of trial and error, which is also described in Supplementary Information Section 3 , we determined that if we used a threshold value of proximity of 0.05 then our model-projection maps would closely approximate defoliation maps.
