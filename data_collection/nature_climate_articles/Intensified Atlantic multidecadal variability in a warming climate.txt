Main The Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) is characterized by an interhemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) dipole pattern, with its positive phase showing a basin-wide warming in the North Atlantic 1 , exerting a consequential impact on adjacent regions and global climate 2 . Modelling studies found that a positive AMV phase is accompanied by an enhanced Atlantic oceanic meridional heat transport across the equator with a reduced atmospheric meridional heat transport in compensation 3 , leading to a northward shift of Atlantic intertropical convergence zone, increased Sahel summer rainfall 4 , 5 and weakened vertical wind shear over the main development region of Atlantic hurricane 6 , 7 . A positive AMV contributes to a negative phase of the multidecadal component of Pacific decadal variability by weakening the atmospheric meridional eddy heat transport, midlatitude winter storm track and the Aleutian Low 8 , resulting in warming over the western North Pacific 9 and cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, which contributed to the global warming hiatus 10 , 11 . The change of the AMV intensity can trigger extreme climate events; for example, a positive AMV is conducive to a heatwave over the Euro-Mediterranean region 12 . Thus, how the AMV may respond to greenhouse warming is an important issue with far-reaching implications. Dynamics of the AMV involve oceanic advective processes 13 , 14 , 15 , ocean–atmosphere coupling 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and external forcings 20 , 21 , but their relative importance remains inconclusive 22 . Interactions between the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the AMV are crucial in determining the multidecadal periodicity 13 , 14 . The AMOC is a system of ocean currents, carrying upper warm water northward and deeper cold water southward in the Atlantic. A strengthened AMOC leads to an anomalous northward Atlantic meridional heat transport 15 , which favours a positive AMV. Warm SST anomalies (SSTa) in the high latitudes from the increase in northward heat transport in turn decrease the meridional density gradient, leading to a slowdown of the AMOC and a reduced advective flux but with a time delay. In addition, ocean–atmosphere dynamical coupling may affect the AMV 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . For example, after reaching the peak phase of a positive AMV, the associated enhancement in subpolar North Atlantic heat loss weakens lower tropospheric baroclinicity and reduces eddy activity in the storm track, contributing to weakened westerly winds and a consequent negative North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) response during boreal winter 16 , 17 . The negative NAO, which features reduced westerlies and a weakened cyclonic circulation in high latitudes, gives rise to reduced surface heat loss and North Atlantic deep water (NADW) formation in the Labrador Sea, conducive to a negative phase of the AMOC and the AMV with some delay 18 , 19 . Further, there is an anthropogenic impact on recent-past tropical AMV 20 . For example, decreasing anthropogenic aerosols favour an increased downward shortwave radiative heat flux, conducive to a positive AMV 21 . However, uncertainty in North Atlantic upper ocean warming trends and climatic impact of aerosols including interactions with cloud prevent a quantification and debates continue 23 . Early studies suggested a decreased amplitude of the AMV under greenhouse warming by using a short period (2006–2099) of data 24 . However, the length of data is short for detection of a multidecadal AMV change, which may introduce uncertainties to the result. Another study using four climate models with multicentury outputs 25 supported a reduction in the AMV, but the AMV indices in future warming scenarios were obtained by regressing these SSTa onto the AMV pattern in the corresponding pre-industrial control (PiControl) simulation in each model. The procedure assumes an identical spatial pattern in different scenarios. This assumption is problematic since the AMV patterns under different scenarios differ from each other. Further, these earlier studies did not separate variability on multidecadal timescale from variability on other timescales. Here, we use outputs of all available models participating in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) 26 and phase 6 (CMIP6) 27 that have a multicentury-long coverage (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ). We focus on AMV at multidecadal timescales and allow the pattern to evolve. We find an intensified AMV under greenhouse warming. Model performance in simulating the AMV Observed AMV pattern is taken as the average from two reanalysis datasets (‘Observation-based data and model outputs’ in Methods ). We use multimodel outputs from CMIP6 to evaluate the simulated AMV. Models are selected according to the availability of data over the period 2050–2299 under a future warming scenario, referred to as shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) and a PiControl simulation of no less than 250 year length, in which several cycles are included (Supplementary Table 1 ). To evaluate the model performance, we compare the spatial pattern and amplitude of the AMV in observations and the contemporary historical simulations during 1870–2014 (‘Observation-based data and model outputs’ in Methods ). The AMV is depicted as the area-weighted average of SSTa over the North Atlantic (75°–7° W, 0°–70° N) separately for each scenario and each model. To focus on the multidecadal scale variability, the AMV index is smoothed by a 21 year running mean. To remove any climate drift in the PiControl, under historical forcing or SSP warming scenarios, the AMV index is biquadratically detrended. The greater effectiveness of our detrending method is confirmed by comparing with several commonly used detrending methods (‘AMV index and its sensitivity to detrending method’ in Methods ). The AMV pattern is derived from regressing the SSTa onto a normalized AMV index in each model under each scenario. The observed AMV spatial structure displays an interhemispheric dipole with enhanced warming in the subpolar region of North Atlantic (Extended Data Fig. 1a ), which is reasonably simulated in CMIP6 (Extended Data Fig. 1b ), with spatial correlation of 0.87. The observed AMV index displays pronounced decadal-to-multidecadal variability which shows a fluctuating range of SSTa of ±0.2 °C (Extended Data Fig. 1c ). Simulated AMV indices capture the decadal-to-multidecadal scale variations, with a comparable range. The PiControl allows an examination of key processes in governing the AMV phase transition and the life cycle, in terms of relationship with the AMOC and evolution of SST, surface net heat flux (Qnet) and boreal wintertime (December–January–February) Arctic sea-ice concentration (SIC). We show the regression pattern of the above fields onto the normalized AMV index at different lags (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). At a lag of 20, that is, 20 years before the peak of AMV, warm SSTa first emerge in the Irminger Seas and Greenland–Iceland–Norway (GIN) Seas, followed by a horseshoe-like pattern extending into the subtropics at a lag of 10 with relative weak anomalies (Extended Data Fig. 2a ). The warm anomalies further develop into the mature positive phase at lag 0, displaying a basin-wide warming with strongest signals in the subpolar region. As the Qnet damps SSTa, the AMOC-related oceanic meridional heat transport is critical in determining the AMV. As warming from the ocean meridional heat transport of a stronger AMOC and intensified AMV develop, sea ice melts (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d ), which would be conducive to a shallowed oceanic mixed layer. However, the stronger AMOC enhances vertical mixing and the NADW formation 28 . The net effect is that the mixed layer deepens, highlighting the dominance of the oceanic deep convection in controlling the mixed layer depth (MLD). The MLD anomalies display the largest signals in the Labrador Sea and the GIN Seas (Extended Data Fig. 2b ). The AMV-related SIC anomalies concentrate in the Greenland Sea, supporting an East Greenland Current pathway for transporting the freshwater anomalies from the Arctic to the subpolar region 28 . Projected increase in the variability of AMV We show an increase in variability of the future AMV by comparing its characteristics in CMIP6 PiControl and SSP scenarios, each of 250 years. We focus on a high-emission warming SSP 585 scenario and discuss other available SSP scenarios as sensitivity tests. The increase in the AMV is reflected in the spatial pattern and the standard deviation change of its index (Fig. 1 ). The AMV pattern is characterized by a basin-wide warming in the North Atlantic, with enhanced SSTa in the subpolar region and a horseshoe-shaped structure extending into the subtropics (Fig. 1a,b ). The AMV intensifies in response to global warming, especially in the subpolar and the subtropical arms of North Atlantic. We further calculate the standard deviation of AMV index in each model under each scenario and compare it between PiControl and SSP scenarios. A total of 16 out of 19 (84.2%) experiments project an increase in the AMV standard deviation under global warming, with the ensemble mean value increased by ~50% under the SSP 585 scenario (Fig. 1c ). In CMIP5, the intensified AMV is robust in the representative concentration pathway RCP 85 scenario, with six out of seven models showing increased AMV variability (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The robustness decreases as the global warming becomes less intense, with four out of seven models showing intensified AMV in RCP 26 and RCP 45 scenarios, probably due to a moderately shallowed MLD and a smaller reduction in AMOC advection, effects of which offset. Fig. 1: Projected increase in AMV variability under global warming. a , The AMV pattern under PiControl scenario, derived from regressing SSTa onto the normalized AMV index in each model. Shown is the multimodel ensemble mean (MMEM) result. b , Same as a , but for the SSP 585 scenario. c , Comparison of the standard deviation (unit, °C) in the AMV indices between the PiControl (blue bars) and four different emission scenarios (red bars): SSP 126, 245, 370 and 585. Models with decreased variability are indicated by blue font. Models simulate an increase in AMV variability under greenhouse warming. Full size image We also compare the power spectrum of the detrended unfiltered AMV under PiControl and a corresponding high-emission warming scenario in each CMIP5/6 model. Models generally simulate two regimes of the AMV, that is, interdecadal 10–30 years and multidecadal 40–70 years. Under global warming, a total of 12 out of 14 models display a spectral shift towards multidecadal scales, leading to a more pronounced multidecadal power spectrum. The shift is supported by a strong model consensus (Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Below we show that the increase in the AMV and the prolonged periodicity are mainly caused by a shallowing MLD and a slowdown in AMOC under greenhouse warming. A shallower mean MLD conducive to the intensified AMV In response to global warming, oceanic MLD in the subpolar gyre of North Atlantic shallows (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Under the PiControl scenario, the deepest climatological MLD is located in the region poleward of 45° N, with the maximum values of up to 516 m in the Labrador Sea and 565 m in the Irminger Sea and GIN Seas, where oceanic deep convection occurs (Fig. 2a ). These are also the regions where the maximum thinning of MLD occurs under global warming (Fig. 2b ). The maximum thinning of 470 m is seen under the SSP 585 scenario, with an area-averaged decrease of 40.8% within the region of 45°–65° N, which is statistically significant above the 99% confidence level.

Shown is the MMEM result. b , Mean state change of MLD between SSP 585 and PiControl (SSP 585 minus PiControl). Shown is the MMEM result. c , Intermodel correlation between changes in the MLD mean state and changes in the standard deviation of AMV indices, both scaled by the ECS in the respective model.

Both are scaled by the ECS in the respective model. Changes are calculated as differences between SSP and PiControl (SSP minus PiControl). Correlation coefficient (cor) and P value are also indicated on the basis of a two-tailed Student’s t -test. A greater shallowing in mixed layer in the subpolar North Atlantic favours a strengthening in AMV variability. Full size image The projected MLD shallowing, accompanied by a reduced effective heat capacity in the upper ocean, favours an intensified AMV. There is a systematic linkage between the shallowed climatological MLD and increased AMV amplitude, with intermodel correlations between changes in grid-point mean MLD and in AMV variability from the PiControl to the SSP scenarios, all scaled by the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in each model 29 to remove intermodel differences in climate sensitivity to global warming. Models simulating a thinner MLD in the subpolar region produce a greater increase in AMV variability (Fig. 2c ). In the North Atlantic subpolar region, a large MLD reduction is accompanied by a large AMV amplitude increase. We define an MLD change index as the average of the MLD change over the region of 45°–65° N. An intermodel correlation between changes in the mean MLD and in the AMV standard deviation shows a statistically significant correlation of −0.76, indicating that the intermodel spread in reduction of MLD accounts for ~58% of the intermodel spread in the intensified AMV (Fig. 2d ). Shallowed mixed layer accompanied by a reduced AMOC A weakening in the AMOC, accompanied by suppressed oceanic deep convection and reduced vertical mixing, leads to a shallowed MLD in the subpolar region 30 , 31 . The AMOC in CMIP6 models weakens by ~54% in SSP 585 scenario (‘The AMOC’ in Methods ), when compared to the PiControl scenario (Fig. 3a,b ). The slowdown of the AMOC is attributed to the anomalous surface heat flux induced by anthropogenic warming 32 , 33 and the freshwater input from an enhanced hydrological cycle, melting of Arctic sea ice or the Greenland ice sheet 34 , 35 . We examine the response of climatological net surface heat flux (Qnet) to global warming by comparing PiControl and the SSP scenarios. A positive Qnet indicates a downward heat into the ocean (Extended Data Fig. 4b ). In the extratropical North Atlantic, most regions are dominated by an upward heat flux into the atmosphere, indicating that on multidecadal timescales Qnet plays a damping role and is a response to the warming ocean, as in the PiControl experiment (Extended Data Fig. 2a ). Fig. 3: Arctic sea-ice loss weakens the AMOC and reduces MLD in a warming climate. a , Mean state of the Atlantic meridional overturning stream function in PiControl experiments. Shown is the MMEM result. b , Same as a , but for the SSP 585 scenario. c , Intermodel correlation between the projected change in the mean AMOC and in the boreal wintertime SIC, both scaled by the ECS in the respective model. Stippling indicates where the correlation is statistically significant above the 95% confidence level on the basis of a two-tailed Student’s t -test. d , A statistically significant (>99.9%) intermodel relationship between projected changes in the AMOC and in the area-averaged MLD in the region of 45°–70° N, 90° W–0°. Both are scaled by ECS in the respective model. Changes are calculated as differences between SSP and PiControl (SSP minus PiControl). Correlation coefficient and P value are also indicated on the basis of a two-tailed Student’s t -test. Surface warming and freshwater input from sea-ice melt increase surface buoyancy, leading to an AMOC slowdown. Reduced vertical mixing associated with the suppressed oceanic deep convection results in a shallowed mixed layer. Full size image All models project a pronounced long-term Arctic sea-ice loss under greenhouse warming (Extended Data Fig. 4c ). The wintertime Arctic sea-ice cover in SSP 585 scenario reduces by ~90% in most of the Arctic Ocean when compared to the PiControl scenario. The associated freshwater input is directly and indirectly, by weakening the AMOC, conducive to a shallowed MLD in the subpolar region. There is a statistically significant intermodel relationship between the Arctic sea-ice reduction and the weakened AMOC (Fig. 3c ); models that produce a greater loss of Arctic sea ice systematically simulate a greater reduction in the AMOC. The positive correlation is seen in most of the Arctic Ocean. Likewise, models that simulate a greater reduction in the AMOC systematically produce a greater thinning of the MLD, with a significant correlation coefficient of 0.97 (Fig. 3d ). The freshwater input stabilizes the upper ocean, weakens the AMOC, enhances the oceanic stratification and suppresses the vertical mixing, contributing to the MLD thinning. Decreased MLD variability favours stronger AMV Riding on an MLD thinning trend is a reduced amplitude of the decadal-to-multidecadal variations in the MLD, which further favours an increase in AMV variability (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Regressions of the MLD anomalies onto the normalized AMV indices in PiControl experiments show a deepening in much of the subpolar region (Fig. 4a ), as a result of mixing from the deep convection of the AMOC (Extended Data Fig. 2c ), despite an increase in freshwater input from sea-ice melt (Extended Data Fig. 2d ). In contrast, the MLD regressions in the SSP 585 scenario show a dipole structure in the subpolar North Atlantic (Fig. 4b ). The dipole pattern in a warming climate reflects local dominance by the positive AMOC that leads to a deepening in the Labrador Sea and Greenland Sea, amid a large freshwater input from Arctic sea-ice loss that leads to a thinning in seas south of Iceland. Fig. 4: Reduced MLD variability further intensifies AMV. a , Regression patterns of MLD anomalies (MLDa) onto the normalized AMV index in PiControl experiments. Shown is the MMEM result. b , Same as a , but for the SSP 585 scenario. c , Sum of the two leading principal patterns of the AMV-related MLDa changes over the North Atlantic, obtained by an EOF analysis across models on the change in MLD pattern, all scaled by the ECS in the respective model. d , A statistically significant (>99.9%) intermodel relationship between sum of the associated leading two PCs and the variability change of the AMV, both scaled by the ECS in the respective model. Changes are calculated as ‘SSP minus PiControl’. Correlation coefficient (cor) and P value are also indicated on the basis of a two-tailed Student’s t -test. Riding on a climatological MLD that is thinning, a reduced amplitude of the multidecadal variations in the MLD further favours an increased variability of the AMV. Full size image To extract the dominant changing pattern, we conduct an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on intermodel changes in MLD anomalies, all scaled by the ECS in each model 29 . In this way, the principal patterns depict the dominant changes among models and the associated principal components (PCs) denote the intermodel differences. We use the two leading EOF patterns and the associated PCs to describe the changing MLD variability, which together account for 72% of the intermodel variance (Fig. 4c ). The role of the changing amplitudes of the MLD variability in affecting the AMV is confirmed in an intermodel relationship between changes in the combined PCs and the standard deviation of the AMV, with a significant correlation coefficient of −0.72 (Fig. 4d ). A greater decrease in MLD variability is systematically linked to a stronger intensification of the AMV. Therefore, a smaller anomalous MLD deepening in the positive phase of AMV overcomes the influence from a reduced oceanic heat transport associated with AMOC, favouring a greater positive AMV amplitude in the future climate. Prolonged advection time of meridional OHT In addition, the AMV amplitude is partly determined by time duration of heat input from the meridional ocean heat transport (OHT). In a warming climate, the prolonged AMV periodicity leads to longer advection time in one AMV cycle. We use the Atlantic meridional OHT to represent the meridional heat advection 36 (‘Meridional OHT’ in Methods ). The Atlantic OHT is northward in both hemispheres and across the equator as a result of the existence of the AMOC (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). Taking the OHT at 46° N as an example, the intermodel relationship between changes in standard deviation of variability of OHT itself and AMV variability shows a weak positive correlation of 0.36 (Extended Data Fig. 7a ). However, when we integrate the OHT over each positive or negative phase respectively (Extended Data Fig. 8 ) to yield a new index of the integral over each phase, the intermodel relationship between changes in standard deviation in variability of OHT integral and AMV variability shows a strong positive correlation of 0.64 (Fig. 5a ). The stronger correlation means that prolonged advection time increases the cumulative input from the heat transport, conducive to the intensified AMV. Fig. 5: Prolonged advection time of meridional OHT favours intensified AMV. a , Intermodel relationship between changes in the standard deviation of variability in the time integral of Atlantic OHT at 46° N and changes in the AMV. Both are scaled by the climate sensitivity in respective model. Correlation coefficient and P value are also indicated on the basis of a two-tailed Student’s t -test. b , Intermodel relationship between the changes in the mean AMOC and in the standard deviation of the AMV indices. Both are scaled by the climate sensitivity in the respective model. Changes are calculated as differences between SSP and PiControl (SSP minus PiControl). Correlation coefficient and P value are also indicated on the basis of a two-tailed Student’s t -test. A greater increase in variability of time-integrated OHT is systematically linked to a greater intensification in AMV variability. Full size image The impact of the shallowed MLD and the weakened AMOC in determining an intensified AMV is illustrated in an oceanic heat budget analysis over the subpolar North Atlantic in the 250 year PiControl simulation (‘Oceanic heat budget analysis’ in Methods ). The meridional heat transport contributes to warm anomalies in the subpolar region, with a net heat flux cooling the ocean (Extended Data Fig. 9 ). The temperature tendency is largely balanced between heat input from mean meridional heat advection and damping by air–sea net heat flux. On the multidecadal scale, if we assume little temperature tendency, a reasonable approximation, a balance holds between the meridional ocean advection term and the net heat flux term (‘Oceanic heat budget analysis’ in Methods ). Given that AMV-related SSTa is largely confined to the high northern latitude, SST variability amplitude ( \(|T{\prime} |\,\) ) is inversely proportional to the mean value of the meridional velocity \(\bar{V}\) and the MLD. Thus, the amplitude of T ʹ would increase as the meridional mean velocity \(\bar{V}\) and MLD H decrease (Figs. 2d and 5b ). Summary Our study investigates the response of AMV in a warming climate by applying all available outputs that have a multicentury long coverage. Different from previous study that assumed a fixed AMV pattern across scenarios and covered all timescales, we do not prescribe a fixed AMV pattern and focus on AMV at multidecadal timescales. Our finding that the amplitude of the AMV probably intensifies under greenhouse warming is underpinned by a shallowed mean MLD in the subpolar region of the North Atlantic and decreased MLD variability, both favouring growth of SSTa. The reduced MLD is in turn contributed by an increased freshwater input from sea-ice melt and a reduced vertical mixing associated with the suppressed oceanic deep convection of the weakened AMOC. In addition, the weakened AMOC and the commensurately slower mean advection prolongs the AMV lifespan, providing a long time for heat input from the meridional heat transport that drives the AMV SSTa. Our result would suggest a prospect of enhanced predictability of the AMV for mitigating the associated impact but further analysis is needed. Methods Observation-based data and model outputs We use two SST reanalysis products, covering a period from 1870 to 2014, to depict the observed AMV. These products are: HadISST v.1.1 (Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset v.1.1) 37 and ERSST v.5 (Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature v.5) 38 . All monthly datasets are annual averaged and interpolated into a spatial resolution of 1° × 1°. We take all available monthly outputs from CMIP5 and CMIP6 models with availability of data over the period 2015–2299 under a future warming scenario (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ). Several scenarios from CMIP5/6 simulations are used. The PiControl runs in which the atmosphere CO 2 is held constant at the pre-industrial level are used for the last 250 years of each model. This represents the internal variability of climate system, which is considered as the ‘prewarming’ period in this study. The ‘historical’ runs, which include both anthropogenic and natural forcings, are used to compare with the observations. To estimate the potential impacts of global warming, CMIP5 models are forced under the RCP emission scenarios and CMIP6 are forced under SSP scenarios. The outputs are used for the period 2050–2299. We focus on a high-emission warming scenario SSP 585 in CMIP6 and discuss other warming scenarios as sensitivity tests. Multiple variables are used from the CMIP archive, including ocean temperature ( T ), sea surface temperature (SST), surface level pressure (SLP), Atlantic meridional overturning stream function (AMOC), mixed layer depth (MLD), oceanic meridional velocity ( V ), zonal velocity ( U ), vertical velocity ( W ), surface latent heat flux (LHF), surface sensible heat flux (SHF), surface longwave radiation flux (LRF) and surface shortwave radiation flux (SRF). All monthly data are annually averaged and interpolated to the same spatial 1° × 1° grid as in the observed data. AMV index and its sensitivity to detrending method The AMV is constructed as the area-weighted average of annual SSTa over the North Atlantic (75°–7° W, 0°–70° N) separately for each scenario and each model. To focus on the multidecadal scale variability, the AMV index is smoothed by a 21 year running mean. To remove the climate drift in PiControl, under historical forcing or under warming scenarios, an AMV index is biquadratically detrended. The AMV pattern is derived from regressing similarly detrended SSTa onto the normalized AMV index in each model under each scenario. We try several commonly used detrending methods 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , but they do not seem as effective, leaving a residual trend. For example, removing a linear detrend fails to remove the nonlinear component of global warming 39 . A previous approach was to obtain the internal AMV by subtracting the SSTa pattern associated with global-mean temperature 40 , 41 . However, when trends in the global-mean SSTa differ substantially from those in the North Atlantic SSTa, residual trends exist in the ‘detrended’ AMV time series (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b ). By contrast, the AMV index using our method is trend-free (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d ). If we remove the MMEM based on seven models under SSP 585 scenarios, models with a higher-than-averaged trend show an upward trend in the residual AMV index and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Another way to represent the forced signals is empirical mode decomposition 42 , which however also leaves a residual trend (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The AMOC The AMOC stream function is calculated by integrating the meridional velocity cross the Atlantic basin and cumulatively in density space 43 . The AMOC index is defined as the maximum transport of the annual-mean meridional overturning stream function within the latitudes of 20°–50° N. Meridional OHT Using annual-mean ocean temperature T ( x , y , z , t ) and meridional velocity v ( x , y , z , t ) fields, we calculate the Atlantic meridional OHT as follows 36 : $${\rm{OHT}}(y,t)=\iint {vT}{\rm{d}}x{\rm{d}}z\times {C}_{\mathrm{p}}\times {\rho }_{o}/{10}^{15}$$ where C p is the heat capacity of seawater taken as 4,200 J kg −1 K −1 and ρ 0 is the density of seawater taken as 1,026 kg m −3 . Statistical significance test Pearson’s correlation measures the strength of a relationship between two variables. We use the Student’s t -test to investigate the significance of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Considering that the two time series are themselves dependent (that is, exhibit temporal autocorrelation), the effective degrees of freedom are reduced. In our analysis we assume an effective degree of freedom 44 as following: $${\rm{d.f.}}=N\left(\frac{1-{\rho }_{{xx},1}{\rho }_{{yy},1}}{1+{\rho }_{{xx},1}{\rho }_{{yy},1}}\right)$$ N denotes the length of data, \({\rho }_{{xx}}\) and \({\rho }_{{yy}}\) denote the autocorrelation coefficient. Oceanic heat budget analysis We use oceanic circulation fields from CMIP6 PiControl simulations covering a 250 year period, to conduct an oceanic heat budget analysis over the upper 500 m of subpolar North Atlantic (35°–65° N, 60°–5° W). The governing equation of SST tendency is expressed as: $$\begin{array}{l}\frac{\partial }{\partial {\rm{t}}}{T}^{{\prime} }=-{U}^{{\prime} }\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\bar{T}-\bar{U}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}{T}^{{\prime} }-{V}^{{\prime} }\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\bar{T}-\bar{V}\frac{\partial }{\partial y}{T}^{{\prime} }\\\qquad\quad-{W}^{{\prime} }\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\bar{T}-\bar{W}\frac{\partial }{\partial z}{T}^{{\prime} }+\frac{Q{\prime} }{\rho {C}_{\mathrm{p}}H}+{\rm{Res}}\end{array}$$ (1) where T ʹ is averaged temperature anomalies over the upper 500 m; \(\bar{U}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}{T}^{{\prime} }\) and \({U}^{{\prime} }\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\bar{T}\) denote temperature anomalies carried by the mean and anomalous zonal advection; \(\bar{V}\frac{\partial }{\partial y}{T}^{{\prime} }\) and \({V}^{{\prime} }\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\bar{T}\) denote the temperature anomalies carried by the mean and anomalous meridional advection; \(\bar{W}\frac{\partial }{\partial z}{T}^{{\prime} }\) and \({W}^{{\prime} }\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\bar{T}\) denote the temperature anomalies carried by the mean and anomalous vertical advection; \(\frac{Q{\prime} }{\rho {C}_{\mathrm{p}}H}\) is atmospheric heating/cooling from net heat flux (positive downward), in which ρ 0 is the density of seawater taken as 1,025 kg m −3 , C p the heat capacity of seawater taken as 4,200 J kg −1 K −1 and H the ocean upper layer depth taken as 500 m; Res is residual which includes mixing and diffusive terms. The surface heat flux includes the latent and sensible heat fluxes, shortwave radiation absorbed in the mixed layer and net longwave radiation emitted from the sea surface. Considering that AMV-related SST is dominated by mean meridional advection associated with AMOC and net surface heat flux, we adopt a simplified heat budget equation below $$\frac{\partial }{\partial t}T{\prime} \approx -\bar{V}\frac{\partial }{\partial y}T{\prime} +\frac{Q{\prime} }{\rho {C}_{\mathrm{p}}H}$$ (2) Considering \(\frac{\partial }{\partial t}T{\prime} \approx 0\) , which is a reasonable assumption on decadal timescale, equation ( 2 ) reduces to: $$\bar{V}\frac{\partial }{\partial y}T{\prime} =\bar{V}\frac{{T{\prime} }_{\rm{north}}-{T{\prime} }_{\rm{south}}}{L}\approx \frac{Q{\prime} }{\rho {C}_{\mathrm{p}}H}$$ (3) here \({T{\prime} }_{\rm{north}}\) and \({T{\prime} }_{\rm{south}}\) are SSTa in the north and south of the North Atlantic sector and L is its meridional width. Given that AMV-related SSTa is larger in the subpolar region relative to the tropical and subtropical region ( \({T{\prime} }_{\rm{south}}\approx 0\) ), then we have the following relationship of SST amplitude ( \(|T{\prime} |\) ) $$\left|T{\prime} \right|\, \approx \left|\frac{L}{\rho {C}_{\mathrm{p}}}\frac{Q{{\mbox{'}}}}{H\bar{V}}\right|$$ (4) Since Q ʹ also increases under global warming (Extended Data Fig. 10 ), the amplitude of T ʹ increases as the meridional mean velocity \(\bar{V}\) and MLD H decrease.
