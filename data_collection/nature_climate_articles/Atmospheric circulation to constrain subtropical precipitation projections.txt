Main The tropical regions encompass some of the wettest and driest expanses on Earth, and alterations in their hydrological cycle due to anthropogenic emissions are of paramount importance. However, precipitation poses a challenge for accurate modelling and stands as a substantial source of uncertainty in climate forecasts. In the tropics, climate models predict a notable increase in zonal mean precipitation in the deep tropics as a consequence of human-induced influences 1 , 2 , 3 . In the subtropics, on the other hand, a substantial projected decline in precipitation is conspicuously evident in the Southern Hemisphere, while anticipated changes in zonal mean precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics are less distinct, exhibiting a small increase 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 . In the Southern Hemisphere, the projected precipitation changes in the deep tropics and subtropics, which were already observed 7 and attributed to greenhouse gas emissions 8 , could be largely explained using thermodynamic arguments. Specifically, the increasing specific humidity leads to a precipitation increase in the deep tropics and a decline in the subtropics 1 , 9 (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). In contrast, in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics, the effect of thermodynamic processes to reduce precipitation could not explain the small subtropical precipitation increase, highlighting the role of dynamic processes in future precipitation changes over this region 2 , 10 (as was noted in previous work 10 , the simple relation linking precipitation changes and the increase in specific humidity does not hold over land, which could partly explain the above hemispheric differences in precipitation). One of the largest dynamic contributors to future zonal mean tropical precipitation changes is the Hadley circulation 2 , 11 , 12 , 13 (HC). In low to subtropical latitudes, the HC accounts for most of the meridional heat and moisture transport, thus considerably affecting the latitudinal distribution of precipitation over those regions. Specifically, while the ascending branch of the HC in the deep tropics carries warm and moist air upward, thus resulting in intense precipitation, the descending branch of the flow suppresses precipitation in subtropical regions, resulting in an arid climate. Yet, the dynamic contribution to future precipitation changes remains a large source of uncertainty 3 , 14 , 15 , partly because human-induced changes in atmospheric circulation are considerably uncertain 3 , 16 . Despite models robustly simulating a weakened Northern Hemisphere HC in recent and coming decades, atmospheric reanalyses indicate a historic intensification of this circulation 17 , 18 . The large uncertainty in historic Northern Hemisphere HC strength changes prevented confining HC strength projections and assessing the associated impacts on regional precipitation. Recent findings, however, have not only shown that the intensification of the circulation in reanalyses is probably artificial 18 , but that they have also, by utilizing sea-level pressure observations, provided strong evidence for the weakening of the Northern Hemisphere HC in recent decades 19 . This weakening is consistent with climate models and has been attributed to anthropogenic emissions 19 , which increases the confidence that the HC will continue to weaken in the coming decades. Constraining Hadley circulation changes The ability of climate models to capture recent HC strength changes, as inferred from observations, presents an opportunity to constrain future circulation changes, and thus also precipitation changes, in the Northern Hemisphere. Our focus here is on the Northern Hemisphere because anthropogenic emissions have a minor impact on the circulation strength in the Southern Hemisphere 20 , 21 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Since anthropogenic emissions largely contribute to the Northern Hemisphere HC strength changes in recent and coming decades 19 , by modulating the static stability 18 , 21 (Supplementary Fig. 2 ), we here find that the distribution of changes in Northern Hemisphere HC strength ( Ψ max ) across models is consistent for historic and future periods (Fig. 1 ); that is, models exhibit a similar sensitivity of HC strength to anthropogenic emissions in recent and coming decades. In the latest suite of climate models (Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP6), under the historical and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)5–8.5 forcings ( Methods ), HC strength changes over the 1960–2014 period are strongly correlated ( r = 0.77; blue dots in Fig. 1 ) with the projected changes in the circulation ( ΔΨ max , estimated as the difference between the last 20 years of the twenty-first and twentieth centuries; green probability distribution shows the distribution of the projected changes). Similar results are also evident under a reduced warming scenario (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Our focus here is on the 1960–2014 period since this is when the availability of sea-level pressure measurements is sufficient to assess the HC strength 19 ( Methods ). Fig. 1: Constraining future Hadley circulation strength changes. Future changes in the Hadley circulation strength ( ΔΨ max ) plotted against the 1960–2014 trends in Ψ max across CMIP6 models (blue dots); their correlation appears in the upper left corner. Blue line and shading show the linear regression ± 2 s.d. ( Methods ). The green, black and purple lines respectively show the probability distributions of ΔΨ max across models, the sea-level pressure observation-based 1960–2014 trend in Ψ max and the constrained ΔΨ max . Full size image The strong linear relationship between recent and future HC strength changes allows us to employ an emergent constraint technique 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 to constrain future circulation changes ( Methods ). By combining the recently found sea-level pressure-based HC weakening over the 1960–2014 period 19 (black probability distribution in Fig. 1 , which accounts for the uncertainty in the linear regression between sea-level pressure and Hadley cell trends, and for the uncertainty in the observed sea-level pressure trend; Methods ) together with the linear relationship between historic and future circulation changes (blue line and shading in Fig. 1 ), we predict a weakening of the HC of −2.6 × 10 10 ± 7.5 × 10 9 kg s −1 (s.d.) by the end of this century (purple probability distribution in Fig. 1 ). Such weakening is ~80% larger than the mean weakening currently projected by CMIP6 models of −1.4 × 10 10 ± 7.2 × 10 9 kg s −1 (compare green and purple probability distributions in Fig. 1 ). We note that while the emergent constraint does not reduce the future model spread (the variance in the two distributions is similar), it does modify the magnitude of circulation changes (the shift towards larger weakening is statistically significant based on a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). Consequently, although there is an overlap between the projected and constrained probability distributions, in the constrained HC there are a ~95% chance of exceeding the currently projected mean weakening and a ~72% chance of obtaining more than a 1.5 times larger weakening, relative to current predictions. This demonstrates a robust change in plausible future HC strength 16 . Lastly, we note that the observation-based HC trend (mean of black line) comprises both the internal variability and the forced response to external forcing 28 . It is thus conceivable that internal variability might set the position of the observed trend within the models’ distribution, and thus also the emergent constraint (this could suggest that future observed trends might yield a different emergent constraint). Similarly, the position of each model trend within the models’ distribution might also be affected by internal variability, which might then set the linear relation between future and historic HC changes. To ensure that it is the forced response to external forcing that set the position of the observed trend as well as the modelled linear relationship, we first assess the impact of internal variability on the modelled linear relationship by examining the linear relationship across different members in single-model large ensembles (Extended Data Fig. 3 ); unlike across CMIP6 models, the different members hold the same forced response but differ in their internal variability. We find that the linear link between historic and future circulation changes is not evident across model simulations with the same forced response, that is, internal variability could not explain the linear relationship. Second, the linear link across CMIP6 models also holds when estimating the HC trends in future periods (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Methods ), that is, the rank of each model within the multimodel distribution relatively remains constant in coming decades, despite the possible changes induced by internal variability. Third, regarding the possible impact of internal variability on the observed trend, we note that the observation-based HC weakening was shown to emerge from the internal variability and was found to be attributed to anthropogenic emissions 19 . In addition, to examine the possible impact of internal variability on the rank of the observed trend within the multimodel distribution, we calculate the percentile of each model’s trend within the multimodel distribution over different 55-year periods starting from different years (1960, 1970,…,2040). The multimodel mean standard deviation across the percentiles of different periods corresponds to Hadley cell trend variations that are half the standard deviation of the models’ 1960–2014 trends (grey shading in Extended Data Fig. 5a ). Even by accounting for this possible variation in position and centering it around the observation-based trend, our analysis still yields a larger weakening of the flow relative to current predictions (compare purple shading and green line in Extended Data Fig. 5a ). In sum, the above analyses demonstrate the robustness of the constraint and the larger role of human emissions in setting the observed and modelled HC weakening relative to internal variability. Constraining precipitation changes Considering the profound influence of the HC on tropical precipitation, will the larger projected weakening of the flow alter the existing predictions for tropical precipitation patterns? To address this question, we examine the impact of circulation changes on future precipitation changes, using the moisture budget equation 2 , 10 , 13 , 29 ( Methods ). First, consistent with previous generations of climate models 1 , 5 , 6 , by the end of this century zonal and annual mean precipitation ( Δ P ) in CMIP6 is projected to increase across all tropical latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (black line in Fig. 2a ). Second, while mean circulation changes contribute to increasing subtropical precipitation (red line in Fig. 2a ), they act to decrease the precipitation in the deep tropics, thereby mitigating the projected precipitation intensification over that region 2 , 10 (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Fig. 2: Constraining future subtropical precipitation changes. a , Future changes in zonal mean precipitation ( Δ P , black line) and the relative contribution from zonal mean circulation changes ( q Δ v , red line). The solid lines and shadings show the CMIP6 mean ± s.d. across models. b , Future changes in subtropical precipitation ( Δ P subtropics , averaged over 15° N–30° N) plotted against future changes in the Hadley circulation strength across CMIP6 models (blue dots); their correlation appears in the middle right. Blue line and shading show the linear regression ± 2 s.d. ( Methods ). The black, purple and red lines respectively show the probability distributions of Δ P subtropics across models, the constrained Δ Ψ max and the constrained Δ P subtropics . Full size image The opposite effects of the circulation on future precipitation in the deep tropics and subtropics are consistent with the projected HC weakening. A weakened HC will act to reduce the rainfall in the deep tropics and will be less suppressive (that is, will tend to increase) of subtropical precipitation. Note that the precipitation increase in the deep tropics is primarily attributed to changes in mean specific humidity (Extended Data Fig. 1 ), emphasizing the role of thermodynamic processes over that region 1 . Therefore, the larger projected weakening of the circulation, as suggested by the emergent constraint analysis, implies a larger increase in subtropical precipitation and a smaller precipitation intensification in the deep tropics (due to a larger mitigating effect) relative to current predictions. Since circulation changes drive the increase in subtropical precipitation, as indicated by the moisture budget equation, we find an emergent relationship between these two factors. The projected HC weakening ( Δ Ψ max ) is well correlated ( r = −0.84) with the projected increase in subtropical precipitation (averaged between 15° N and 30° N) across CMIP6 models (blue dots in Fig. 2b ; choosing different subtropical latitudes yields similar results, Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Consequently, we conduct an additional emergent constraint analysis where the constrained projected weakening of the flow (purple lines in Figs. 1 and 2b ) together with the above moisture budget-based linear relationship yields a projected increase in subtropical precipitation of 0.31 ± 0.1 mm day −1 , which is ~2.5 times larger than the currently projected precipitation increase of 0.13 ± 0.1 mm day −1 . Here, as well, the emergent constraint does not reduce the future model spread, but does robustly modify the magnitude of precipitation changes; in the constrained precipitation, there is a ~95% chance of exceeding the currently projected precipitation mean increase and a ~67% chance of obtaining more than a doubling of precipitation increase relative to current predictions. We note that since historic HC trends are used to constrain the projected HC changes (Fig. 1 ), the former yields a similar constraint on precipitation projections via the same moisture budget term (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c ). Next we extend our analysis to regional scales and show that our results also hold regionally over subtropical areas of precipitation increase (Fig. 3 ). Specifically, across most of the subtropics—including Africa, Asia and over the Pacific Ocean—precipitation is projected to increase (Extended Data Fig. 7 ). Analogous to the zonal mean analysis, in these regions, the projected increase in precipitation correlates with the projected circulation weakening (Fig. 3a,b ). This might stem from the presence of the longitudinally varying meridional overturning circulation in these areas 30 , 31 , 32 , which indeed has been found to contribute to an increase in precipitation 2 . We note that most of the precipitation increase over those regions occurs during summer and autumn, and consistently, during those seasons most of the circulation-induced subtropical precipitation changes are evident (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Fig. 3: Constraining regional subtropical precipitation changes. a – c , The same as in Fig. 2b but for subtropical precipitation changes averaged over Africa and Asia (20° W–120° E) ( a ), the Pacific Ocean (120° E–110° W) ( b ) and the Atlantic Ocean (110° W–20° W) ( c ) (see grey rectangles in Extended Data Fig. 7 ). Full size image Furthermore, conducting an emergent constraint analysis for each region yields in an increase in projected precipitation relative to current predictions. The constrained precipitation is projected to increase by 0.52 ± 0.2 mm day −1 over Africa and Asia, which is ~1.8 times larger than the currently projected precipitation increase of 0.29 ± 0.14 mm day −1 . Over the Pacific Ocean, the emergent constraint yields a precipitation increase of 0.52 ± 0.2 mm day −1 , which is ~2.2 times larger than the currently projected precipitation increase of 0.23 ± 0.2 mm day −1 . In contrast, over the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation is projected to decline (Extended Data Fig. 7 ). Consistently, over this region, in the climatology, the meridional overturning circulation is less evident 30 , 31 , 32 and thermodynamic processes were found to reduce the precipitation 2 . Indeed, unlike in the other regions, the decline in precipitation over the Atlantic Ocean is not linked to future HC changes (Fig. 3c ). This regional analysis further supports the physics underlying the emergent constraint: regions experiencing an increase in precipitation are associated with weakening of the flow. Lastly, it is important to note that unlike HC strength changes, the historic and projected subtropical precipitation changes are only weakly linked (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). This arises since unlike the historic circulation weakening, which has already modulated (and is linearly linked to) subtropical precipitation (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f and Supplementary Fig. 5a,b ), evaporation processes have not yet considerably increased the precipitation, which might allow internal variability to obscure the linear link between historic and projected precipitation changes (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). This highlights the added value of using circulation changes to constrain precipitation predictions. In addition, not only are the above emergent constraints also evident under a reduced warming scenario (Extended Data Fig. 2 ), but the linear relationships identified in CMIP6 are also consistent in CMIP5, which increases the reliability of the emergent constraint analyses. Specifically, across CMIP5 models, the projected HC weakening is well correlated both with the projected increase in subtropical precipitation and with the HC strength trends, and produces similar slopes as in CMIP6 (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10 ). The linear link between HC strength trends and its projected weakening by the end of the twenty-first century is evident in CMIP5 models only when examining the circulation trends in later periods in comparison to CMIP6. This discrepancy arises because the HC weakening in CMIP5 is delayed relative to CMIP6. For example, the multimodel mean HC in CMIP6 begins to weaken in the mid-1970s, while in CMIP5 it begins in the early 1990s (Extended Data Fig. 10b ). Consequently, most CMIP5 models do not capture the recent weakening of the HC—not a single CMIP5 model exceeds the observation-based trend and only ~40% of the models are within its ±2 standard deviations range—whereas most CMIP6 models do (12% of the models exceed the observation-based trend and ~70% of the models are within its ±2 standard deviations range). Although CMIP5 models cannot be used to constrain future HC and precipitation changes (due to the lack of an emerged linear link when using historic circulation trends), once the weakening of the flow occurs, the same linear relationship between HC trends and its projected weakening is found in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Extended Data Fig. 10a ). This consistency gives us confidence in the robustness of the emergent constraint analyses. The underlying physical processes Next, we examine what physical processes result in the more pronounced projected HC weakening, as inferred from the emergent constraint analysis. To achieve this, we utilize the Kuo–Eliassen equation that comprises the different components that affect the HC, including static stability, latent heating, eddy heat and momentum fluxes, and zonal friction ( Methods ). We find that the Kuo–Eliassen equation adequately captures the projected changes in the HC 21 and the stronger weakening under the emergent constraint analysis (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, the sum of the relative contributions of each variable in the equation to the constrained projected weakening yields a similar change in the projected HC weakening (by 80%), as found by directly calculating the HC strength (compare ‘All’ and ‘Sum’ points in Fig. 4 ). These results lend us confidence in using the Kuo–Eliassen equation for elucidating the processes responsible for the larger projected HC weakening. Fig. 4: The source for the larger Hadley circulation weakening. The difference between the mean projected Hadley circulation weakening, as inferred from the emergent constraint analysis, and the mean weakening currently projected by CMIP6 models plotted against the P value, calculated on the basis of a Student’s t -test of whether the difference between the distributions’ mean is statistically significant (marked by ‘All’). The vertical blue line marks the 0.05 P value. Colours show the correlation coefficient from the emergent constraint analyses. Also shown is the contribution of each term in the Kuo–Eliassen equation: eddy heat flux ( v ′ T ′), eddy momentum flux ( u ′ v ′), static stability ( S 2 ), diabatic heating ( Q ), zonal friction ( F ) and the sum of all contributions (Sum), to the larger projected weakening of the flow as inferred from the emergent constraint analysis. Full size image The emergent constraint analysis indicates a more pronounced weakening of the flow compared with current predictions predominantly due to changes in static stability and diabatic heating ( Q and S 2 in Fig. 4 ; each contributes ~25%–30% greater projected weakening). Moreover, not only are the contributions of these two variables to the projected HC changes well correlated with historic circulation changes (colours in Fig. 4 ), but they also lead to a statistically significant shift towards greater HC weakening based on a Student’s t -test, that is, P values smaller than 0.05 (right to the vertical blue line). Other variables, in contrast, have minor and statistically non-significant effects on the shift towards greater HC weakening. The effects of static stability and diabatic heating reflect the dependence of the HC on the vertical temperature profile and the meridional gradient of diabatic heating, respectively. Specifically, the projected stabilization of the troposphere was found to weaken the HC, while the projected increase in the meridional gradient of diabatic heating was found to strengthen the flow 21 (the same mechanisms also operate over the historic period, Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Thus, the combined impact of these two variables, resulting in a more pronounced projected weakening of the flow, implies a stronger stabilization of the tropical troposphere and a smaller increase in the meridional gradient of diabatic heating relative to the current projections. Discussion Unlike thermodynamic changes in the climate system (for example, surface warming, sea-ice melting and so on), which have been attributed with high confidence to anthropogenic emissions, there is currently a large uncertainty in future large-scale atmospheric flow changes 3 , 16 . Given the large climatic impacts of the large-scale flow, such uncertainty reduces the confidence in climate projections, and thus our preparedness for future climate changes. Emergent constraint analyses can be used to constrain future climate changes and reduce projection uncertainties 24 , 33 . In this study, we employ emergent constraint analyses and utilize the recently found observation-based Northern Hemisphere HC weakening to restrict the range of projected HC changes. This emergent constraint points to a stronger weakening, by the end of this century, of the HC compared with the weakening currently predicted by climate models. By employing a dynamical equation for precipitation, we establish an emergent relation between subtropical precipitation changes and circulation changes. This approach enables us to use the constrained projected HC weakening to also constrain future regional subtropical precipitation changes. The constrained precipitation distribution has a mean value which is more than twice the current multimodel mean projected subtropical precipitation increase, and it has a ~70% chance of exceeding a doubling, specifically over Africa, Asia and the Pacific Ocean. Our effort joins previous work that used emergent constraint techniques to restrict future precipitation changes 4 , 27 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 . The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report concluded that there is low confidence in the projected impacts of the HC on subtropical precipitation 3 . Our results, which show that the future HC weakening will act to increase subtropical precipitation, hold large societal impacts, given the scarcity of water in arid and semi-arid subtropical regions. Overall, by constraining future circulation changes, our results increase the confidence in precipitation projections. Methods The Hadley cell strength The Hadley cell strength is defined, following previous studies 17 , 18 , 19 , 40 , as the maximum value, at 500 mb, of the meridional mass streamfunction ( Ψ ), $$\varPsi (\phi ,p)=\frac{2\pi a\cos \phi }{g}\int_{0}^{p}\overline{v}(\phi ,p)dp,$$ (1) where ϕ and p are the latitude and pressure, respectively; a and g Earth’s radius and gravity, respectively; and \(\overline{v}\) is the zonal and annual mean (denoted by an overbar) meridional velocity. We here focus on the annual mean Hadley circulation changes (1) since historic Hadley cell strength changes (which are used here to constrain the projected circulation changes) are available and mostly evident in the annual mean 18 , 19 , (2) since the projected weakening of the flow occurs throughout the year 41 and (3) for consistency with the discussion in the latest IPCC report 3 . CMIP Monthly data from 42 CMIP6 (ref. 42 ) models (all models with available sea-level pressure, meridional wind and precipitation data were used) and 40 CMIP5 (ref. 43 ) models (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) were examined under the historical forcing (through 2014 for CMIP6 and through 2005 for CMIP5), and under the SSP5–8.5 and SSP3–7.0 (between 2015–2100 for CMIP6) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)8.5 (between 2006–2100 for CMIP5) experiments. We analysed the ‘r1i1p1f1’ member from each CMIP6 model and the ‘r1i1p1’ member from each CMIP5 model to weigh all models equally (and to not mix different representations of internal variability/forced response across the models). To estimate the internal variability of Hadley cell trends, we calculated all 55-year trends from the last 200 years of the models’ pre-industrial control runs (total of ~2,770 55-year trends). We also made use of four single-model large ensembles (LEs): ACCESS-ESM5 (40 members), CanESM5 (25 members), MIROC6 (50 members) and MPI-ESM1-LR (30 members) under the historical and SSP5–8.5 experiments. These large ensembles enabled us to investigate how internal variability affects the emergent constraint we find. We stress that unlike the CMIP6 ensemble, the forced response is the same across all members of each ensemble, and differences across ensemble members are solely due to internal variability. Lastly, for the Kuo–Eliassen equation analysis, we also made use of daily data from 13 CMIP6 models. Emergent constraint analysis To improve the accuracy of Hadley cell strength and precipitation forecasts, we utilized an emergent constraint approach. At its core, an emergent constraint establishes an empirical relation between variations in different climate models for a specific observed climate feature (termed the ‘predictor’) and the corresponding variations in projected future climate conditions (termed the ‘predictand’). This connection, when significant, robust and understood, empowers the use of predictor observations to confine and refine the range (for example, probability distribution) and magnitude of projections for the predictand, thereby reducing uncertainties entailed in model-based projections. Specifically, here we exploited the strong linear relation we found between recent and future Hadley cell strength changes, and used the recently found observation-based Hadley cell weakening 19 to constrain the projected changes in the Hadley cell strength. We also exploited the linear relation we found between future Hadley cell and subtropical precipitation changes, and used the above constraint on the Hadley cell strength projection to constrain subtropical precipitation changes. In each analysis, the linear relation was estimated using a total least square linear regression, where the uncertainties in the predictor and predictand were estimated, following previous work 33 , as the standard deviation across all LE members (pooled together), after removing the mean LE value from each member. The uncertainty of the regression was estimated by performing 100 bootstrap replacement procedures to the CMIP6 data and repeating the regression analysis for each replacement, which yielded 100 values of the predictand for each predictor value. The uncertainty in the regression (that is, the P { x ∣ y } distribution) was estimated using the standard deviation across the 100 predictand values. Lastly, the constrained probability distribution ( P ( y )) was estimated, following previous work 22 , 23 , as follows, \(P(\,y)=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty }P(x)P\{x| \,y\}dx\) , where P ( x ) is the probability distribution of the predictor and P { x ∣ y } is the probability distribution of y linear regression values at each x , estimated from the bootstrapping procedure. To increase the confidence in emergent constraint analyses, it is important to verify that the emergent constraints are discernible across various datasets and uphold a robust physical rationale for the predictor–predictand correlation. Here, the linear relations between the projected weakening of the flow and both the projected increase in subtropical precipitation and the Hadley circulation strength trends are also evident under different warming scenarios and in CMIP5 models (Extended Data Figs. 2 , 9 and 10a ). Furthermore, while the link between future Hadley cell weakening and subtropical precipitation stems from the moisture budget equation, the link between historic and future Hadley cell strength changes stems from the fact that they are both driven by anthropogenic emissions, resulting in a similar distribution of Hadley cell changes across models. Historic circulation changes Here we used the same methodology as in our recent work 19 to estimate the historic changes in the Northern Hemisphere Hadley circulation strength and constrain the projected weakening of the flow. Below we provide a short description of the calculation of historic Hadley circulation strength changes. From the zonal and meridional momentum equations, one can derive a mathematical link between the strength of the circulation and the meridional gradient of sea-level pressure (PSL y ) (blue dots in Supplementary Fig. 8 ). By exploiting this physically-based relation and using the 1960–2014 trends of PSL y measurements (taken from the International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set; ICOADS) (black probability distribution in Supplementary Fig. 8 , constructed using the mean PSL y trend and its standard error), one can constrain the recent circulation trends (purple probability distribution in Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The 1960–2014 period was chosen for the analysis since over this period, ICOADS provides a uniform cover of oceanic sea-level pressure measurements in the Northern Hemisphere tropics 19 ; we here used only ICOADS as a sea-level pressure product since reanalyses hold artificial PSL y and Hadley cell strength trends 18 , 19 . We note that the uncertainty in the resulting Hadley circulation trends stems both from the uncertainty in the linear regressions (calculated as described above) between sea-level pressure and Hadley cell trends, and from the uncertainty in the observed sea-level pressure trend, which includes internal variability and inherent year-to-year observed PSL y biases. We found that the resulting uncertainty in the observation-based Hadley cell trend is only slightly larger than the uncertainty that arises from internal variability (estimated from long pre-industrial control runs, Extended Data Fig. 5b ). This suggests that most of the uncertainty probably stems from internal variability. Future circulation trends In addition to using large ensembles to demonstrate that the internal variability does not set the linear relationship between future and historic Hadley cell changes, we also estimated how much the linear relation between trends in the Hadley cell and its changes by the end of this century remains throughout the twenty-first century. To this end, we calculated 55-year Hadley cell strength trends, starting from different years (1960, 1970,…,2040). The correlation between each 55-year Hadley cell trend and the future Hadley cell changes by the end of this century (estimated as the difference between the last 20 years of the twenty-first and twentieth centuries) is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4 and reveals strong linear relationship also in coming decades. To estimate how the rank of each model within the multimodel distribution changes over time, we calculated the percentile of each model’s trend within the multimodel distribution at each 55-year period. The multimodel mean of the standard deviation of each model’s percentiles across these periods estimates the magnitude of model rank shifts. In future decades, variations in the Hadley cell trend due to changes in each model’s rank within the trend distribution are only half the standard deviation across the 1960–2014 model trends (grey shading in Extended Data Fig. 5a ). Even by accounting for this variability and centering it around the observed trend, our analysis still indicates a stronger weakening of the flow than current predictions suggest (compare purple shading and green line in Extended Data Fig. 5a ). Moisture budget To explain the physics underlying the link between future Hadley circulation changes and precipitation changes, we made use of the vertically integrated zonal and time moisture budget equation 2 , 44 , which can be written as follows, \(\overline{P}=-\frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial }{r\cos \phi \partial \phi }\int_{0}^{{p}_{s}}\left(\overline{v}\,\overline{q}+\overline{{v}^{{\prime} }{q}^{{\prime} }}\right)\cos \phi dp+\overline{E}\) , where P and E are the surface precipitation and evaporation, respectively, q is specific humidity and prime denotes deviation from time and zonal means. Decomposing each term in the moisture budget to its twentieth century value (defined as the mean over the last 20 years of the twentieth century) and the difference between the last 20 years of the twenty-first and twentieth centuries ( A 21 = A 20 + Δ A ) yields the following equation: $$\Delta \overline{P}=-\frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial }{r\cos \phi \partial \phi }\int_{0}^{{p}_{s}}\left(\left[\overline{v}\,\right]\Delta \overline{q}+\left[\overline{q}\,\right]\Delta \overline{v}+\Delta \overline{{v}^{{\prime} }{q}^{{\prime} }}\right)\cos \phi dp+\Delta \overline{E},$$ (2) where square brackets denote the mean of the two periods. Equation ( 2 ) suggests that the future precipitation changes are affected by changes in mean specific humidity ( \(\overline{v}\Delta \overline{q}\) ), mean circulation ( \(\overline{q}\Delta \overline{v}\) ), eddy moisture flux ( \(\Delta \overline{{v}^{{\prime} }{q}^{{\prime} }}\) ) and surface evaporation ( \(\Delta \overline{E}\) ). We here estimated the eddy flux contribution as the residual of equation ( 2 ). Kuo–Eliassen equation To elucidate which physical processes resulted in the larger weakening of the circulation, as inferred from the emergent constraint analysis, we examined the Kuo–Eliassen equation 45 . The Kuo–Eliassen equation is a linear second-order partial differential equation for the meridional mass streamfunction, which is derived from the quasi-geostrophic momentum and thermodynamic equations 46 , and can be written as follows: $$L\varPsi ={D}_{{v}^{{\prime} }{T}^{{\prime} }}+{D}_{{u}^{{\prime} }{v}^{{\prime} }}+{D}_{Q}+{D}_{F},$$ (3) where \(L={f}^{\,2}\frac{g}{2\pi a\cos \phi }\frac{{\partial }^{2}}{\partial {p}^{2}}+{S}^{2}\frac{g}{2\pi a}\frac{\partial }{a\partial \phi }\frac{1}{a\cos \phi }\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi }\) is a second-order operator; f is the Coriolis parameter; \({S}^{2}=-\frac{1}{\rho \theta }\frac{\partial \theta }{\partial p}\) is the static stability; ρ is the density; θ is the potential temperature; \({D}_{{v}^{{\prime} }{T}^{{\prime} }}=-\frac{R}{p}\frac{\partial }{a\partial \phi }\frac{1}{a\cos \phi }\frac{\partial \overline{{v}^{{\prime} }{T}^{{\prime} }}\cos \phi }{\partial \phi }\) , where v ′ T ′ is the eddy heat flux; \({D}_{{u}^{{\prime} }{v}^{{\prime} }}=\frac{f}{a\,{\cos }^{2}\phi }\frac{{\partial }^{2}\overline{{u}^{{\prime} }{v}^{{\prime} }}{\cos }^{2}\phi }{\partial p\partial \phi }\) , where u ′ v ′ is the eddy momentum flux; \({D}_{Q}=\frac{R}{p}\frac{\partial \overline{Q}}{a\partial \phi }\) , where R is the gas constant of dry air and Q is the diabatic heating; and \({D}_{F}=-f\frac{\partial \overline{F}}{\partial p}\) , where F is the zonal friction force. The diabatic heating was estimated from the zonal and annual mean quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation, \(\overline{Q}=\frac{1}{a\cos \phi }\frac{\partial \overline{{v}^{{\prime} }{T}^{{\prime} }}\cos \phi }{\partial \phi }\) \(+\overline{\omega }(\frac{\partial \overline{T}}{\partial p}-\frac{\overline{T}\kappa }{p})\) , where T is temperature, ω is the pressure vertical velocity, k = R / c p and c p is the specific heat capacity. The zonal friction force was estimated from the annual and zonal mean zonal momentum quasi-geostrophic equation, \(\overline{F}=\frac{1}{a{\cos }^{2}\phi }\frac{\partial \overline{{u}^{{\prime} }{v}^{{\prime} }}{\cos }^{2}\phi }{\partial \phi }-f\;\overline{v}\) . Decomposing each term in equation ( 3 ) as follows, A = A 20 + Δ A , yields the following equation: $${L}_{20}\varDelta \varPsi =-\varDelta L{\varPsi }_{20}+\varDelta {D}_{{v}^{\prime} {T}^{\prime}}+\varDelta {D}_{{u}^{\prime} {v}^{\prime}}+\varDelta {D}_{Q}+\varDelta {D}_{X}-\varDelta L\varDelta \varPsi .$$ (4) Solving the above equation allowed us to diagnose the contribution of changes in static stability (that is, the operator, Δ L Ψ 20 ), eddy heat flux ( Δ D v ′ T ′ ), eddy momentum flux ( ΔD u ′ v ′ ), diabatic heating ( Δ D Q ), zonal friction ( Δ D X ) and the multiplication of changes in the operator and in the streamfunction ( Δ L Δ Ψ , estimated as a residual) to future changes in the meridional mass streamfunction between the last 20 years of the twenty-first and the twentieth centuries ( Δ Ψ ). Lastly, we estimated the contribution of each term to the greater weakening of the circulation as inferred from the emergent constraint analysis. This was achieved by repeating the emergent constraint analysis, but with a modification: the projected circulation changes (the predictand) were replaced by each term in equation ( 4 ). We note that the contribution of Δ L Δ Ψ to the larger constrained Hadley circulation weakening is small since the sum of all other contributions yield almost the same shift in the weakening of the flow, as inferred when using the projected circulation changes (compare ‘Sum’ and ‘All’ dots in Fig. 4 ).
