decomposed the total amount and intensity targets to each branch (subsidiary), and included
energy saving and emission reduction, pollution reduction and carbon reduction into the contracts
on the performance of the Company’s management and the main officers of each subsidiary and
branch. We have set up the “Greenhouse Gas Verification and Audit Center” to comprehensively
strengthen the verification and audit of greenhouse gas emissions. We have also actively conducted
research on methane & volatile organic compounds (VOCs) cooperative monitoring technology
and greenhouse gas recycling in oil and gas fields.
Controlling Methane Emission
In 2021, the Company continued to increase the efforts for vent gas recycling. Through technical
innovation, equipment revamp, management improvement and other measures, the Company has
achieved the reduction of vent gas emissions in oil and gas exploration, oil and gas exploitation,
natural gas processing, oil and gas storage and transportation, etc., in particular, the contributions of the vent gas emission reduction in the oil and gas exploration process and in oil and gas
exploitation accounted for more than 60% and 20% respectively in the total vent gas emission
reduction, which effectively reduced the methane emission intensity

capture and carbon sequestration, implement carbon dioxide flooding and
carbon dioxide sequestration on a large scale, continuously expand the
“zero carbon” and “negative carbon” industries, and enhance the carbon
sequestration capacity and scale of the ecosystem
We continued to enhance carbon trading performance and carbon asset management. By
establishing a management system for carbon emission rights trading, we regulated the participation
in carbon emission right trading. We set up a dedicated carbon trading team, and have initially
formulated a series of management regulations and policies, such as Guidance on Strengthening
Greenhouse Gas Control, Measures for Management of Greenhouse Gas Information, Measures for
Management of Carbon Trading, and Measures for Management of Carbon Industry Development.
As one of the first ten companies to participate in the carbon market trading in China, we are an
active player in the construction of the national carbon market. We encouraged our subsidiaries
and branches and affiliated entities to develop national voluntary emission reduction projects and
strengthen the carbon quota performance management of our subsidiaries and branches. In 2021,
all of our subsidiaries and branches that were on the list of the national carbon emissions trading
market fulfilled their contracts
The Company supported and actively participated in the construction of China’s carbon sink forest, and continuously conducted afforestation
activities in the operation area, staff living area and surrounding communities. In 2021, the Company participated in voluntary afforestation by
403,200 person times, and planted 1,937,900 trees; the total area of existing green field reached 289.4 million square meters; and we built 510
mu of Ma’anshan Carbon Neutral Forest in Daqing Oilfield. We supported local landscaping by means of direct participation and funding, with
