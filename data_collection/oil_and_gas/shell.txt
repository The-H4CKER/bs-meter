Our climate target

Achieving net-zero emissions is part of our Powering Progress strategy.

Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Find out more about how we are working to achieve this target and our progress so far.
Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge.

That is why we have set a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
This means net-zero carbon emissions from our operations. It also means net-zero carbon emissions from the energy products we sell, including those produced by others, which currently account for over 90% of the total emissions we report. Our other targets include:

    Reduce our absolute emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 2016 levels on a net basis. This covers all emissions in Scope 1, which come directly from our operations, and Scope 2, from the energy we buy to run our operations.
    By 2025, eliminate routine flaring of natural gas, which generates carbon emissions, from our upstream operations.1
    Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030.

In March 2024, we also set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 (2021 reference year)2

    By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016.
     Our overall methane emissions intensity in 2023 was 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas.
    As another way to measure our progress, we have set short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell.
    Net carbon intensity3 measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services — such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.

    We are aiming to reduce our net carbon intensity by the following amounts over the following periods, compared to a 2016 baseline:

2-3% by 2021 - achieved
3-4% by 2022 - achieved
6-8% by 2023 - achieved
9-12% by 2024
9-13% by 2025
15-20% by 2030
100% by 2050
To decarbonise our operations, we are:

    making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, lower-carbon energy solutions.
    we are also decommissioning and divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;
    improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
    transforming our remaining integrated refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;
    using more renewable electricity to power our operations;
    developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities;
    reducing methane emissions.

We are also providing more lower-carbon energy solutions such as charging for electric vehicles, hydrogen and electricity generated by solar and wind power, and we are using technology to safely capture and store carbon emissions. For remaining emissions, we offer carbon credits including from nature-based projects.
