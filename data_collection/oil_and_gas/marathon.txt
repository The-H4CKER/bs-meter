A Message from Our CEO
When the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) issued its first guidance in 2017, we were
the first independent refiner to issue a TCFD-aligned report
later that same year. We believed then, and continue to
believe now, that a thorough understanding of the risks and
opportunities inherent in our industry’s evolution is critical
to implementing the right programs and projects, setting
the right goals and making the right investments at the right
time.
In this report, we provide you with insight into our
governance and enterprise risk management processes.
We believe these efforts provide us with a detailed look at
the energy landscape, including the risks it poses to our
business, the opportunities it offers us and how we are
responding to both.
We continue optimizing our core fuels manufacturing and
logistics businesses and expanding our natural gas business
while strategically, and in disciplined fashion, investing in
renewable and low-carbon energy solutions. Hydrocarbon
fuels are critical to today’s economy and are likely to
continue to be for the foreseeable future, even under many
climate scenarios aligned with the Paris Climate Accords.
Therefore, optimizing how they are manufactured and
moved is important to energy markets. It is also foundational
to our environmental stewardship commitment.
Part of our optimization efforts include the goals we have
set for GHG reductions. We are targeting a 30% reduction
of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by 2030 from
2014 levels, and we are on track to meet this goal ahead
of schedule. 2023 marked the ninth year in a row where
we reduced Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity. We
are therefore extending the aforementioned goal to a 38%
reduction by 2035. Additionally, we have reduced our
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 - Category 11 GHG emissions
by over 25 million tonnes CO2e since 2019.
One element of our disciplined approach to achieving GHG
reductions is our Focus on Energy program, which has
helped us establish industry-leading recognition in energy
efficiency. MPC’s refineries have earned more U.S. EPA
ENERGY STAR® awards than all other refiners in the U.S.
combined. The energy saved through our efforts amounted
to over 1.5 billion Btu/hr in 2023, representing more than
$45 million in cost savings.

Similar to the success of our Focus on Energy program, our
Focus on Methane program has yielded substantial results
as we work toward our goal of a 75% reduction of MPLX
Gathering and Processing methane emissions intensity
by 2030 from 2016 levels. By the end of 2023, we had
achieved a 57% reduction.
Our investments in renewable fuels likewise make significant
contributions to the ongoing reduction of our companywide
carbon intensity. In 2023, we delivered approximately 2.6
billion gallons of renewable fuels, avoiding about 13 million
tonnes of GHG emissions. Our renewable fuels facilities in
Dickinson, North Dakota, and Martinez, California, produce
renewable diesel – a drop-in replacement for petroleumbased diesel – and we have been producing ethanol
for gasoline blending through our joint venture with The
Andersons for over a decade. Through our investment last
year in LF Bioenergy, we are participating in its growing
portfolio of dairy-based, low-carbon intensity renewable
natural gas facilities.
Accountability for our environmental goals is a critical driver
of our progress in these areas. For 2024, our annual bonus
program includes a non-financial scorecard, which will be
a holistic assessment of our environmental, safety and
human capital performance. Progress on our Scope 1 and
2 GHG intensity target is included in the assessment of our
environmental performance.
As economic and regulatory factors change the global
energy landscape, we are positioning ourselves to lead in
sustainability and succeed over the long term. I invite you to
read this year’s Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios
report to learn important details about the many ways we
are working toward that goal.
I am pleased for the progress we have made and conscious
of the work ahead that will be needed to reach our goals.
Sincerely,

Maryann T. Mannen
President and CEO, MPC and MPLX

Introduction
Since 2017, MPC has published an annual
Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios report,
following the recommendations from the Task Force
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
In this report, we provide our stakeholders with a
summary of how we identify and manage climaterelated risks and opportunities, our governance
structure around climate-related risks and
opportunities, and our enterprise risk management
process for establishing, assessing and managing
climate-related risks. We also provide a review of
our business against various “less than 2-degree”
scenarios, including several 1.5 degree scenarios,
available through the International Energy Agency
(IEA) and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC).
The evolution toward a lower-carbon economy,
combined with events such as geopolitical unrest or
disruptions in trade flows, can impact energy security
and reduce public support of climate initiatives. This
situation recently occurred with the increased use of
coal in several European countries due to the energy
supply disruptions associated with the Ukraine-Russia
conflict. Furthermore, in addition to meeting the rising
energy demands of a growing population, many who
are seeking to improve their current standard of living
will continue to rely on the ability to access reliable
and affordable sources of energy.

According to
approximately
world without
over 2 billion
cooking fuels.1

the IEA, there remains
775 million people in the
access to electricity, and
without access to clean

Long-term energy security must be achieved in
parallel to carbon-reduction ambitions to better
ensure economic and societal development.
There is not one preordained path to achieving the
Paris Agreement’s primary ambition of limiting global
warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared
to pre-industrial levels. Numerous modeled pathways
to reach the well below 2 degrees Celsius goal have
been published by entities such as the IEA and IPCC
and their partners. While some modeled pathways
rely heavily on eliminating fossil fuels to achieve
the desired outcome, others rely on more inclusive
energy strategies, such as replacing coal with natural
gas, relying on renewables, enhancing energy
efficiency, nuclear, climate smart agriculture practices,
carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, and
other lifestyle changes.
We believe energy supply and technologies will
continue to evolve, and we are excited to be
engaged in its evolution. In 2023, we were one
of the largest suppliers of renewable fuels in the
U.S., delivering approximately 2.6 billion gallons of
renewable fuel to customers. This was accomplished
via production at our renewable fuels facilities,
as well as blending ethanol into our gasoline and
biodiesel into diesel fuel. Through a joint venture,
we started North Dakota’s first dedicated soybean
processing complex, which is expected to produce
approximately 600 million pounds per year of refined
soybean oil for exclusive use by MPC as a feedstock
to produce renewable fuels. We also invested in LF
Bioenergy to produce renewable natural gas (RNG)
from dairy operations. LF Bioenergy began producing
RNG at its first plant located in upstate New York in
April 2023.

Beyond evaluating our business against various
carbon-constrained scenarios, this report will also
discuss our focus on taking concrete steps to reduce
our emissions in the short term via our climate-related
metrics, some of which are tied to compensation.
Through the efforts of our dedicated employees, our
year-on-year reductions are putting us on pace to
achieve our operational targets ahead of schedule.
Furthermore, this report will cover how our metrics
will be updated alongside the evolution of the climate
and energy landscape.
Overall, we are committed to implementing solutions
that result in environmental benefits while providing
reliable, affordable energy that makes modern life
possible. We believe the disclosures and analyses in
this report, in our latest 10-K and on our website help
demonstrate that MPC and MPLX are well positioned
for the future, even in a carbon-constrained economy.

Risk Management
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
PROCESS
We utilize an enterprise risk management (ERM)
process to assess and manage material risks within
the company. Our enterprise risk manager leads the
process through quarterly workshops involving our
executive leadership team and the subject matter
experts associated with the various risks. Two of
these enterprise risks are “Low Carbon and Energy
Evolution” and “ESG and Stakeholder Expectation”,
which include discussion and oversight of our
climate-related risks, opportunities and metrics. The
MPC and MPLX Boards of Directors receive routine
updates on the ERM risks throughout the year.

ERM COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE

COMPLIANCE-RELATED RISK
As part of our ERM process, our Board oversees
risks related to the regulatory landscape. These
risks include emerging and proposed regulations
related to issues that have the potential to impact
our business, such as GHG and other air emissions,
water withdrawals and effluents, hazardous materials
management, product specifications, and employee
health and safety.

We disclose material risks to our company in the
Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form
10-K and other filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Categories of risk described
in these reports include:
• Business and operational risks
• Financial risks
• Legal and regulatory risks

The evolution of our climate-related disclosures and metrics helps demonstrate the
effectiveness of our governance process for climate-related matters.

An ERM Community of Practice supports the ERM
process and workshops. It comprises mid-level risk
and assurance representatives across our value
chains to discuss, develop and standardize best
practices and risk mitigation measures throughout
the company. The Board’s Audit Committee further
evaluates performance trends and internal processes
to ensure effectiveness of the ERM process.

Strategy and Scenario Planning
The energy landscape is continually evolving to address the complex issues of energy security and
mitigating climate change. Across the U.S., there are significant investments in lower-carbon energy
technologies spurred, in part, by government policies and strategies to decarbonize the economy. We
conduct scenario planning to evaluate how various differing future energy outcomes could impact our
company. We continually evaluate the climate-related risks and opportunities associated with these
different scenarios to understand where we should invest capital to strengthen our existing assets and
where to invest in new growth opportunities.
Our scenario planning includes evaluating both long-term and short-term scenarios. Throughout this
section, we provide detailed analyses of our business strategies against future scenarios from the
IEA, IPCC and data from other sources, such as the EIA and HSB Solomon Associates LLC (Solomon).
Scenarios provide our company with many potential versions of the future so we can plan ahead and
adjust appropriately as the future unfolds. It is important to remember that scenarios are hypothetical
constructs; they are not sensitivity analysis. In this year's report, we apply the following hypothetical
scenarios:
• IEA Announced Policies Scenario (APS)1 — assumes that all long-term emissions and energy access
targets, including net-zero commitments, will be met on time and in full, even where policies are not yet
in place to deliver them.
• IEA Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)1 — sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve
net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, updating the IEA analysis first published in 2021. While the APS is
exploratory, the NZE Scenario is normative, as it is designed to achieve the stated objective and show
a pathway to that goal.
• IPCC Scenarios2 — refers to the 16 vetted IPCC Scenarios, identified by the IEA, that reach net-zero
energy sector emissions by 2050. Because they reach net-zero energy sector emissions by 2050,
they are comparable in terms of energy sector ambition with the IEA NZE Scenario.

Scenarios are not forecasts or predictions of the future. Rather, they
highlight central elements of a possible future and draw attention to key
factors that could drive future developments. Scenarios aim to provide
governments, companies and other stakeholders with a range of potential
outcomes to consider.

Potential Risks and Opportunities
MPC and MPLX face a multitude of risks, including
climate-related risks, which are typically categorized
as transition risks and physical risks. According to
the TCFD, transition risks relate to the transition to a
lower-carbon economy, and physical risks relate to
the physical impact of climate change. Examples of
these risks can be found on this page, but please see
item 1A in MPC's and MPLX's latest Form 10-K reports
for a more comprehensive list of risks we may face.

Technology Risks

POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES

• Technology breakthroughs relating to renewable
fuels or other fuel alternatives, such as hydrogen or
ammonia, or efficiency improvements for internal
combustion engines, could reduce demand for
traditional transportation fuels.

Resource Efficiency

Market Risks

The energy evolution may also produce opportunities
for MPC and MPLX, examples of which can be found
on this page.

• Continued consumer acceptance and market
penetration of electric, hybrid and alternative fuel
vehicles may decrease demand for petroleum-based
transportation fuels.

POTENTIAL TRANSITIONAL RISKS

winter storms, as well as earth movement in variable,
steep and rugged terrain, and terrain with varied or
changing subsurface conditions.

Chronic Physical Risks
• Our assets could be subject to chronic physical risks,
such as sea-level rise or longer term water shortages.

• We consider energy efficiency to be a core business
function and opportunity because it reduces costs
and GHG emissions, enhancing long-term cost
competitiveness.
• Reduced freshwater use intensity increases resiliency
and reduces long-term operating costs.

Energy Source
• The availability and procurement of lower-carbon or
renewable energy to power our operations could further
reduce the life-cycle carbon intensity of the fuels and
products we manufacture.

Products and Services, Markets and Resilience
• Continued coal-to-natural gas switching and production
of blue hydrogen could increase demand for natural gas.
• Continued demand for renewable diesel as a drop-in
replacement for fossil diesel can help further diversify
our portfolio.
• Research and development of other renewable fuels
could provide new products and markets, increasing
revenues.
• Domestic production, processing and export of LNG to
Europe and other regions facing energy security issues
may steadily increase as these regions look to secure
energy from the United States.
• Increased demand for NGLs as petrochemical feedstock
or cleaner cooking fuel in the developing world could
strengthen demand for NGLs processed by our facilities.
• Our MPLX pipelines and rights of way are potentially
positioned to transport hydrogen and CO2 as those
markets develop.

Business Planning and Capital Allocation
At MPC and MPLX, our investments strengthen the competitive position of our
assets, increase our resilience and allocate growth capital between traditional and
low-carbon investments. As shown to the right, we have undergone a significant
evolution since becoming an independent company in 2011. Today we are focused
on optimizing our core refining and logistics portfolio, expanding our natural gas
business and investing capital in renewable energy and lower-carbon solutions.
We have moved from being a player in not only the U.S. refining sector, but also
the renewable fuels and natural gas sectors.

MPC’s capital allocation can be broken down into sustaining capital and growth
capital. Sustaining capital underpins our commitment to safety and environmental
performance and represents approximately 35% of MPC’s anticipated 2024 capital
spend. The remainder is growth capital, which we invest in a disciplined fashion
in areas that we believe will enhance our competitiveness. Of MPC’s anticipated
2024 growth capital, approximately 40% can be attributed to low-carbon projects
which, for example, can help lower GHG emissions at our refineries or represent
investments in renewable fuels. The remainder of growth capital is aimed at
projects that enhance margin and reduce cost and will primarily occur at our large,
competitively advantaged facilities to help position MPC well into the future.

Climate Scenario Analysis for Refining and Marketing
There are a multitude of possibilities for how the future energy system will evolve to address climate
change and energy security. How and the extent to which the world decarbonizes is dependent
on multiple factors, including technology innovation, geopolitical stability, and government policies
and regulations. Several countries, including the United States, have already developed energy
strategies and put forth initiatives that are more inclusive of lower-carbon technologies in an effort
to meet the goals of various climate scenarios. However, as the future unfolds, balancing these
carbon-reduction efforts, while meeting growing energy demand and security, will be challenging as
we navigate what is expected to be a nonlinear path toward a lower-carbon future.

Global Oil Production in 20233
Rest of World 44%
United States 16%
Russia 12%
Saudi Arabia 12%

Global oil demand hit a record high in 2023 and is currently expected to reach another year of
record oil consumption in 2024. The outlook for this year is estimated to be about 1 million barrels
per day of incremental demand over 2023.1 Much of this is primarily driven by the growing need for
transportation fuels as 90% of the energy consumed for transportation is currently sourced from oil.2
To help support this growing demand, the United States produced more crude oil than any other
nation in 2023.3 As a significant producer of petroleum and other liquids, and as an exporter of
finished products, the United States is projected to remain an integral part of the global oil market.

There is no singular pathway to keeping the world's temperature
increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The IEA identified 16 IPCCvetted scenarios as achieving the same outcome as its NZE Scenario.4
While the NZE Scenario relies on steep reductions in oil supply, other
comparable IPCC Scenarios employ more inclusive strategies to achieve
the same outcome.

The refined products that we produce at MPC's refineries and transport to consumers through our
logistics network are critical to today’s economy and expected to be critical for the foreseeable
future even under many peer-reviewed and Paris-aligned climate scenarios. We utilize scenario
analyses to stress test our assets against many future energy systems that are different than today's
energy system. For this publication, we present a variety of externally-modeled scenarios that
achieve the global average temperature outcomes of the Paris Agreement. Specifically, we have
analyzed supply under the IEA APS and NZE Scenarios, along with 16 additional peer-reviewed
IPCC scenarios.

Relative to 2019, the IEA NZE Scenario reflects an oil supply decrease by 78% in
2050.1 Nonenergy products, such as asphalt and bitumen or feedstock for the
petrochemical sector, are expected to remain relatively stable and are projected
to make up a majority of the remaining oil volumes as transport fuel demand falls.
Similarly, relative to 2019, the APS Scenario indicates an oil supply decrease but
at a less aggressive total of 46% by 2050, in which only 34% of the oil is used for
nonenergy purposes. These scenarios indicate significant transitions away from
oil, which would inherently include a substantial rationalization of global refining
capacity. The degree to which this rationalization would occur will depend on the
scenario and a multitude of factors.

As the industry evolves towards a potential world with lower oil supply, it is
unlikely that every company with petroleum refining or logistics assets would
experience the same degree of rationalization. Refined products are commodities,
and in commodity industries, the most cost-efficient operation typically remains
competitive during periods of rationalization. Typically, less competitive refineries
would be challenged to remain in production due to market competition.
Furthermore, rationalization of these refineries may not occur uniformly across all
markets due to factors such as region specific policies, regulations and supply
security. As part of a collective effort to reduce the global GHG emissions intensity
of oil and gas operations under any respective scenario, all producers, including
ones that may be less vulnerable to rationalization, should individually reduce
the GHG emissions of their own operations. As such, we remain committed to
strengthening the resiliency of MPC's business and investing in energy efficiency
improvements to help reduce the GHG emissions of our own operations.

THE RESILIENCY OF U.S. REFINERS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET
MPC retained Solomon to evaluate the resiliency of our refining assets.1 Our costs
are affected by prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as
changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. As shown in the chart
below, the U.S. refining industry has a lower overall cost structure than the rest of
the world. This is in part due to less expensive natural gas, which is a significant
operating cost to refineries. This cost disparity has been widened by the disruption
in energy markets caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

• Strengthening our portfolio by ceasing crude processing at three less

• Adhering to strict capital discipline to evaluate proposed growth projects against

Through these actions, we expect our refining assets will retain cost
competitiveness into the future, even in a carbon-constrained economy.

The U.S. refining industry remains cost advantaged
compared to the rest of the global fleet. Furthermore, the
average production costs of MPC’s refineries continue to
be below the national average.

Refining Capacity Rationalization Risk Analysis
Total global refining capacity is expected to remain relatively stable in the near
term. Refining capacities scheduled to come online over the next five years
currently outpace the total capacity of announced closures, thereby increasing
total global refining capacity by less than 5%.2 However, rationalization could
become more pronounced if transportation fuel demand peaks in the late 2020s
and more so if demands continue to decrease.
One analysis has indicated that over 21% of global refining capacity is at risk
for rationalization by 2030.3 Europe was identified as having the most capacity
at high risk for rationalization. For North America, the sites identified for risk of
closure represent only 3% of North America’s total refinery capacity. Furthermore,
these sites are considered to be low or medium risk. This is in part due to the
rationalization that already occurred within the U.S. during COVID. Between 2019
and 2024, nine refineries ceased operations in the U.S., including three refineries
within MPC's system. As a result of these closures, the U.S., and furthermore MPC,
remain cost advantaged relative to the world and at lower risk for rationalization.

By 2040, some scenarios include substantial rationalization of global, refining
capacity. This rationalization is expected to occur in Europe along with some
impacts in North America. However, like today, North America is expected to
continue to maintain its position as the region with the second most oil refining
capacity behind Asia.1
With the availability of low-cost natural gas and our complex and geographically
well-positioned refining systems, including optimal accessibility of crude, we
believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest
of the world.

MPC assessed its refining asset competitiveness using the World Oil Refining
Logistics and Demand (WORLD®) model in a well below 2 degree scenario with
approximately 20 million barrels per day less oil demand in 2030 compared to
2019. The U.S. refining sector is examined in-depth. Additionally, developments in,
and competition with all other world regions are analyzed in areas such as carbon
regimes, market disruptions, fuel regulations, crude export policies, and trade and
refining outlooks.

The results of this analysis indicate that the U.S. refining
sector would remain globally competitive in a carbonconstrained future, with minimal rationalization expected.
Furthermore, the analysis indicated no rationalization

Climate Scenario Analysis for Midstream

Natural Gas: As shown to the right, many net-zero
scenarios indicate worldwide natural gas demand
could remain stable or even increase through 2050
as the world takes steps to decarbonize. U.S.produced natural gas can help enhance energy
security, as exemplified by the EU-US Task Force
on Energy Security established in 2022. The task
force seeks to reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian
energy.2 In 2022, the United States more than
doubled its exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to
the EU, exporting 56 billion cubic meters (bcm), up
from 22 bcm in 2021. This trend has continued, with
the U.S. supplying nearly half of the EU's LNG imports
in 2023.3

NGLs: Demand is expected to remain strong for
the nonmethane fractions of natural gas, which
are important feedstocks for the petrochemical
industry (e.g., steam cracking). The IEA projects
petrochemical feedstock demand to be higher than
today even under the NZE Scenario.4 Furthermore,
there remains a continued need for clean cooking
fuel in the developing world, which will combat
indoor air pollution where people still rely on coal and
traditional biomass.4
Midstream Energy Infrastructure and Exports: The
continued strong outlook for U.S. crude, natural
gas and NGL production will require additional
infrastructure to link supply to global demand
markets. Our pipelines, processing and fractionation
facilities, terminals and transport vessels are well
situated to connect to export facilities. The IEA
projects that almost all the growth in U.S. natural gas
production will be destined for export.

As the world evolves toward a power system
comprised of more renewables, natural gas can be
leveraged as a transition fuel that provides reliable
and affordable power with a lower-carbon footprint
than coal. It is a well-demonstrated and versatile fuel
source that can effectively lower GHG emissions, as
it produces about half the emissions for the same
amount of energy as coal.1 Furthermore, during times
of volatility and geopolitical tensions, which can
cause spikes in energy prices and consequently,
increases in coal use, U.S.-produced natural gas can
help buffer emissions increases by providing a more
secure, lower-emitting energy alternative to coal.
Additionally, the U.S. EIA has been revising electricity
sales forecasts upward due to expectations of power
demand from data centers. Given its significant
advantages, strong demand for natural gas is
expected to continue into the future.

NATURAL GAS IS A PROVEN EMISSIONS REDUCTION MODEL
In the United States, the switch from generating electricity from coal to natural gas is the leading
contributor to the reductions in the CO2 emissions rate from fuel combustion by over 1 billion tonnes
per year below levels from 2005.1 Over this period, natural gas demand increased nearly 50%,
equivalent to approximately 28.1 billion standard cubic feet per day (scfd).2 This was accomplished
through significant private investment across all key segments of the natural gas system, including
production, gathering and processing, distribution and storage, and transmission. This coal-to-naturalgas strategy has maintained a stable electric grid, kept prices affordable and facilitated a significant
increase in renewable power without disrupting electricity supplies. This is a proven energy model
that can be replicated throughout much of the world to reduce near-term GHG emissions.
As one of the largest natural gas producers in the world, the United States has successfully leveraged
natural gas as an emissions reduction strategy. This is in stark contrast to China and India, which
have experienced a large increase in coal use and collectively still produce nearly two-thirds of their
electricity from coal combustion.

From 2020 to 2023, the United States retired 44 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power plants.
These retirements were eclipsed by over 130 GW of net coal-fired power capacity added by
China and India at 121 GW and 12 GW, respectively.3 In addition, China is currently planning
to add additional coal-fired capacity, signaling they intend to continue coal use.

To support near-term gaps in supply and demand resulting from technology shifts towards renewable
energy and to stabilize energy supplies for the future, multiple scenarios are relying heavily on LNG
as a transition fuel. Significant shifts away from oil and gas without a reliable and affordable backup
energy source have impacted energy markets with volatile short-term price spikes, making coal an
attractive, cheap alternative to quickly bring down energy prices when political pressure increases.
For example, when natural gas prices spiked after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this prompted
European nations to rely on coal in lieu of natural gas, increasing global CO2 emissions by around
well over 100 million tonnes.4 With transportation flexibility, LNG is projected to play an increasingly
vital role in interregional trade. In 2023, the U.S. exported more LNG than any other country, and is
projected to continue increasing net exports over the next decade.5 If the United States and other
areas of the world leveraged the full potential of natural gas, including supplying LNG to China and
India, billions of tonnes of additional near-term CO2 reductions could be realized worldwide.

MPLX'S PARTICIPATION IN U.S. GHG EMISSIONS
REDUCTIONS
Since 2015, we have invested over $20 billion to acquire and
expand natural gas gathering and processing capacity through
our master limited partnership, MPLX. This has resulted in
MPLX growing into one of the largest natural gas processing
companies in the U.S. These investments facilitated the buildout of infrastructure in the Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins,
among others, and helped to significantly reduce the carbon
intensity of the U.S. energy supply chain. This infrastructure
build-out corresponds with the increase in natural gas electricity
generation shown on Page 16. During this period, electricity
demand remained relatively flat, while CO2 emissions from
electricity generation fell significantly.
When evaluating the gross emissions facilitated by these
investments, MPLX’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions grew year
over year as gathering and processing infrastructure build-out
progressed. However, when emissions that were avoided from
coal-to-gas switching are considered more comprehensively,
MPLX's investments helped to facilitate the decrease in GHG
emissions achieved by the U.S. electric power sector.

MPLX processed ~9.0 billion cubic feet per
day of natural gas in 2023, which could
produce 445 billion kWh of electricity.
The annual volume of natural gas processed by MPLX avoids an
estimated 273 million tonnes of CO2e from the U.S. energy supply
chain per year when compared to coal for electricity generation.

A full conversion of the remaining U.S. coal power plant fleet
to natural gas could result in an additional 410 million metric
tonne reduction in CO2 emissions per year. This is achievable
today without the use of unproven technology or a complete
transformation of the energy supply chain. Worldwide, if natural
gas were embraced, the world could achieve billions of tonnes
of additional CO2 reductions per year, and more if CCUS is
deployed.

Climate Scenario Analysis of Renewable Fuels

Although most renewable fuels today are not currently net-zero fuels,
the processes to produce them are becoming more efficient, with
several liquid renewable fuels today delivering a 50% to 80% reduction
in embedded life-cycle GHGs when compared to the fossil-based fuels.1
Each renewable fuel has a unique carbon intensity (CI). The carbon
emissions associated with each point in the value chain are added
together to determine the CI of the fuel. Carbon reductions anywhere
along the value chain, such as changes in farming practices, more
efficient refining or incorporating renewable energy, will result in a lower
CI value for the fuel. Some renewable fuels, like renewable natural gas
collected from dairy farms, can even have a net-negative CI.1

Liquid renewable fuels are derived from biomass and waste feedstocks
and include ethanol, biogasoline, biodiesel, renewable diesel and
sustainable aviation fuel. Because renewable fuels are sourced from
biomass materials (e.g., plants and animal fats) or existing sources
of methane (e.g., renewable natural gas), the CO2 released from
combusting these fuels is part of the current carbon cycle and offset by
the CO2 recently removed from the atmosphere. As a result, combusting
these renewable fuels does not increase net atmospheric CO2 levels.

Renewable fuels are an important tool to reduce the carbon intensity of
liquid and gaseous fuels because they can be used in existing engines
and infrastructure. As shown to the right, each of the vetted IEA and
IPCC net-zero scenarios model significant increases in renewable fuels
over the next 30 years. However, renewable fuels can be expensive to
produce. For example, many renewable feedstocks are more expensive
today than finished petroleum-based transportation fuels even before
any processing takes place. As a result, renewable fuels rely heavily
on government programs to incentivize production. Examples include
the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), California Low Carbon Fuel
Standard (LCFS) and various blending mandates throughout the
world. Some products, like sustainable aviation fuel, can struggle to
be economic even with subsidies. Without the market mandates and
subsidies, production would not be economical as compared to the cost
of traditional transportation fuels.

RENEWABLE LIQUID FUELS
MPC has a robust renewable liquid fuels portfolio
that delivered approximately 2.6 billion gallons of
renewable fuels to customers in 2023, making us one
of the largest marketers of renewable fuels in the U.S.
One of our goals is to continually lower the
carbon intensity of the products we offer to
our customers, and this volume of renewable
fuel avoids approximately 13 million tonnes of
CO2 transportation emissions per year.1

Over the past four years, over $1 billion has been
invested to convert two of our petroleum refineries
to produce renewable diesel. In 2020, we completed
the conversion of our Dickinson, North Dakota,
refinery, which produced nearly 154 million gallons
of renewable diesel and other renewable products
in 2023. We also formed a 50/50 joint venture with
Neste in 2022 to complete the conversion of our
Martinez, California, refinery and began producing
renewable diesel in the first quarter of 2023. We
expect to reach full capacity by the end of 2024.
Green Bison Soy Processing, a joint venture with
ADM, is North Dakota’s first dedicated soybean
processing complex, and its production of refined
soybean oil will be supplied exclusively to MPC as
a feedstock for renewable fuels. This new, stateof-the-art processing plant, which began receiving

soybeans in late 2023, enhances our ability to source
and optimize logistically advantaged feedstock
for our growing renewable fuels business. This
facility is expected to deliver enough soybean oil
to produce approximately 75 million gallons per
year of renewable diesel. Furthermore, Green Bison
Soy Processing was recognized by the Economic
Development Association of North Dakota as the
2023 Economic Development Project of the Year.
We recently expanded our renewable fuels portfolio,
with an equity investment in LF Bioenergy, a company
that produces renewable natural gas (RNG) from
dairy operations. The joint venture is focused on
developing and growing a portfolio of dairy-based,
low carbon-intensity RNG projects. The first plant,
located in upstate New York, started operating in the
first half of 2023. Dairy-based RNG has a negative
carbon intensity because it captures biomethane that
is currently entering the atmosphere, instead using it
as fuel or feedstock for industrial purposes, thereby
lowering its global warming potential.2,3 Dairy-based
RNG has a carbon intensity typically in the negative
150 to negative 400 grams of CO2 per megajoule
range, as compared to conventional natural gas with
a carbon intensity of approximately 80 grams of CO2
per megajoule.2
The Green Bison and LF Bioenergy projects
represent hundreds of millions of dollars in
investment, and we continue to evaluate a
broad portfolio of options to further expand our
renewable fuels portfolio. MPC brings value through
our expertise and where we believe our capital
investment will result in positive returns.

CARBON CAPTURE, UTILIZATION AND SEQUESTRATION
Carbon Capture, Utilization and
Sequestration (CCUS)
MPC and MPLX support the continued development
and use of CCUS technology as a strategy to reduce
emissions of CO2 and the carbon intensity of the
products we supply.
As identified by the IPCC and IEA, CCUS
technologies are expected to play a key role in
achieving long-term carbon reduction goals. It is an
effective and proven technology that can enable
efforts like low-carbon hydrogen production, a
resource that can further support the decarbonization
of “hard-to-abate” sectors, such as petroleum refining,
chemical and steel manufacturing, and heavy-duty
transportation and shipping.

However, to date, CCUS technology has been used
in limited applications. To further the goal of largescale CCUS development and deployment and to
make progress toward reducing GHG emissions, U.S.
legislation through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
and Inflation Reduction Act is providing substantial
funding to support these efforts. Furthermore, private
companies, federal, state and local governments,
policy institutions, academia, national laboratories
and others are bringing their resources and expertise
to bear. MPC supports the continued development
and use of CCUS technology and strive to enable
stakeholders to leverage regional resources and
advantages to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Managing Physical Risks to Our Facilities
Our facilities are subject to acute physical risks, such
as floods, hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, wildfires,
extreme temperatures and winter storms, and chronic
physical risks, such as sea-level rise and drought. We
have incurred and will continue to incur additional
costs to protect our assets and operations from such
physical risks and employ the evolving technologies
and processes available to mitigate such risks. To the
extent such severe weather events or other climate
conditions increase in frequency and/or severity, we
may be required to modify operations and incur costs
that could affect our business.

accompanied by an unprecedented Category 4
storm surge, and Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which
was accompanied by record rainfall and regionwide
flooding. Neither of these major storms caused any
material flooding to our Galveston Bay operations.

Managing Acute Physical
Risks

Our Garyville refinery is positioned on a local high
point and is currently protected by an external levee
system that runs along the Mississippi River with
several spillways both upstream and downstream
of our facility. This system has adequately protected
the refinery from significant flooding, including during
severe hurricanes like Katrina in 2005, Gustav in
2008 and Ida in 2021. In addition, an 18-mile levee
system called the West Shore Lake Pontchartrain
Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System
is currently being constructed by the Pontchartrain
Levee District with federal and local funding to
protect areas around the refinery from a storm surge
in Lake Pontchartrain.

EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS –
HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes and tropical storms pose potential risks
to our Gulf Coast assets through excessive winds,
storm surge and/or flooding. Efforts to mitigate these
weather-related risks include measures to protect
against flooding, hardening infrastructure to protect
against wind damage and electrical upgrades to
ensure power supply continuity.

External Flood and Storm Surge Controls
Our two Gulf Coast refineries and associated
logistics assets are protected from storm surge and
flooding through external levee and pump station
systems. Our Galveston Bay refinery is protected
by an external levee and pump station system that
protects 36 square miles of land in the Texas City
area. This levee, ranging in height from 19 to 23 feet,
has provided adequate protection through several
storms, including Hurricane Ike in 2008, which was

TEXAS CITY HURRICANE FLOOD PROTECTION

Dickinson

In fact, our Galveston Bay refinery continued to
operate throughout Hurricane Harvey, albeit at
reduced rates, due to interruptions at the ports
and pipelines that supply crude to the refinery and
transport finished products from the refinery. We were
able to quickly increase throughput as ports and
pipelines reopened since we did not shut down.

Beyond these external barriers, we have
implemented additional safeguards within MPC's
Gulf Coast operational areas, including locating most
pumps and compressors on foundations above grade
and adopting hurricane preparedness measures
that are implemented well before a storm can impact
operations.

Managing Acute Physical Risks (continued)
Facility Hardening and Other Measures
Wind and/or water damage to our control systems
or electrical motors could lead to significant repair
costs or downtime to our Gulf Coast operating sites.
In recent years, new centralized control rooms were
built at our Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries to
withstand wind and storm surges characteristic of the
most extreme weather in their respective locations:
• Galveston Bay's centralized control room is built to
withstand winds from a Category 5 hurricane and
located approximately 20 feet above grade.
• Garyville’s centralized control room is built to
withstand a Category 3 hurricane and located
five feet above grade. This design represented
worst-case conditions at the refinery based upon
thousands of simulated hurricane scenarios making
landfall along the Louisiana coast.
These hardening measures are designed to protect
the main control systems at our two Gulf Coast
refineries so they may remain in good operational
standing during extreme weather events. Beyond our
control rooms, we also designed process vessels,
storage tanks and other logistical assets to withstand
significant winds, so they typically experience little to
no damage even in the most significant hurricanes. On
occasion, we have experienced some wind damage to
insulation and cooling towers; however, this damage
is repairable and has not hindered the restart or
operation of our assets.

Electrical Infrastructure and Power Supply
We continue to proactively implement a multiyear
program to replace and upgrade electrical
infrastructure at our refineries. Improvements include,
but are not limited to, cable replacement, highresistance ground installations, combining substations,
installing new safety features and elevating
infrastructure to avoid flooding. Our refineries on the
24

Gulf Coast each have redundant power supplies
and historically have experienced few problems
maintaining power during severe weather events,
including hurricanes. Our other facilities – such as fuel
terminals and pipeline stations – historically exposed
to hurricanes or other severe weather elevate power
infrastructure above historic flood levels and maintain
a combination of on-site generators and contracts
for rapid procurement of generators in the event of
power loss. Notably, in 2017, all our operations in the
greater Houston area maintained power throughout
Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath.

Extreme heat could potentially increase in frequency,
severity, and duration from climate change. Rising
temperatures can cause significant damage, repair
costs, and service interruptions to infrastructure,
specifically energy infrastructure. Increases in
extreme heat can lead to increased peak electricity
demand. The higher demand places considerable
stress on the components of the electric grid,
which can result in a reduction in energy supply,
consequently leading to an increase in energy costs
and/or heightening the risk of equipment failures and
power outages during periods of peak demand.

EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS: WINTER
STORMS AND HEAVY RAINFALL

Wind/Wildfire

Extreme Temperatures/Winterization
Refineries in regions that experience freezing
and extreme winter weather have implemented
winterization plans that identify both short- and
long-term actions to ensure the refinery is prepared
for winter every year. The plans describe the steps
each year that the refinery needs to implement to
prepare for inclement weather along with long-term
projects to winter-proof equipment. The Galveston
Bay Refinery completed a project to winterize its onsite cogeneration (cogen) facility that generates both
electricity and heat. The project involved installing
enclosures around 192 temperature-sensitive
instruments, replacing dozens of steam/condensate
manifolds and supplying remote monitoring capability
to identify potential problems more quickly.
Hard freezes in 2021 and 2022 disrupted
cogeneration operations. However, during a
statewide cold snap in January 2024, the project’s
upgrades allowed the facility to run efficiently and
reliably even as news reports noted Texas industrial
sites reported 36 weather-related upsets – including
unintentional emissions releases – to the state’s
environmental agency.

Facilities could experience wind effects due to
potential changes in wind patterns associated with
climate change. Potential refinery impacts include
wind damage. The forceful impact of strong winds,
which may be amplified by climate change, can result
in considerable harm to structures, equipment, and
vital infrastructure of industrial facilities; however,
refinery infrastructure is typically designed for a wind
load of up to 120 mph. A refinery is not likely to be
adversely affected by excessive wind speeds and/
or extended periods of elevated winds due to the
physical rigidity and inherent strength of refinery
infrastructure components. Overhead electrical and
communication utility lines could be affected by
excessive wind speeds; however, refineries typically
have redundant measures in place to mitigate the
effects of any potential downed wires.
Wildfire effects may occur due to potential changes in
wildfire occurrences associated with climate change.
The presence of ash and smoke in the air could
create adverse conditions for refinery personnel.
Such conditions may necessitate facilitating additional
personal protective equipment (PPE) to mitigate the
effects of poor air quality.

Pipeline Integrity Management
Our midstream segment owns, leases or has an
ownership interest in approximately 19,000 miles
of pipelines throughout the United States. We
continuously monitor and manage the integrity of our
pipeline systems based on changing conditions. One
of the programs monitors stream crossings using a
powerful combination of physical inspections and
predictive modeling. By doing so, we identify and
proactively relocate pipeline segments deeper below
waterway beds to reduce risk of future scouring if
flow conditions change due to increased rainfall or
increased development.

Our robust programs and procedures help us
to safely maintain our operations throughout
severe weather incidents and quickly recover. We
have standing agreements in place for alternate
workspaces, necessary office equipment and
multiple means to maintain internet and telephone
connectivity, even during prolonged power outages.

We also have agreements for supplies such as
generators, repair materials, water and more. We
maintain an emergency mass-notification system to
communicate with personnel before, during and after
an emergency. This information assists in providing
humanitarian aid to our personnel, contractors and
local communities.

We have approximately 500 MPC and MPLX employees
on our corporate emergency response teams. Additional
employees are active in the emergency response teams
within the various operating organizations.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND
RESPONSE
Beyond maintaining our physical assets, we also
prepare and train personnel to respond in the
event of an emergency such as a major flood, fire
or hurricane. We have a dedicated Emergency
Preparedness Group that coordinates preparedness
and response activities throughout the company. This
enables us to respond rapidly and appropriately if an
emergency incident occurs.
We train personnel in the Incident Command System,
a globally recognized organizational structure
designed to integrate resources across multiple
agencies and organizations when an emergency
event occurs. To maintain readiness, we conduct
training sessions that include tabletop exercises with
a review of our emergency plans and resources.
We also conduct periodic training simulations that
involve federal organizations, such as the U.S. EPA or
the U.S. Coast Guard; state environmental protection
or wildlife agencies; local emergency responders,
such as fire departments and law enforcement; and
representatives of tribal governments.

Managing Chronic Physical Risks
SEA-LEVEL RISE
In 2019, the IPCC published the Special Report
on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing
Climate, which included potential sea-level rise in
various representative concentration pathway (RCP)
scenarios. The high emissions scenario, RCP 8.5, had
the highest sea-level rise, with a median value of 0.84
meters (2.76 feet) and likely range of 0.61 to 1.1 meters
(2.00 to 3.61 feet).
MPC operates five coastal petroleum refineries
located in Anacortes, Washington; Garyville,
Louisiana; Texas City, Texas (Galveston Bay); Los
Angeles, California; and Kenai, Alaska. We also have
one coastal joint venture renewable fuels facility
in Martinez, California, and 18 coastal terminals
located in Alaska, California, Florida, Louisiana,
Texas and Washington. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s sea-level rise viewer
can be used to screen for potential flooding levels
due to sea-level rise. At 4 feet of sea-level rise,

which is above the high end of the likely range in the
high-emissions scenario, flooding was not indicated
at our Anacortes, Garyville, Galveston Bay or Los
Angeles refineries or the majority of our terminals.
The tool did identify a low level of flooding at the
northern end of the Martinez joint venture facility at
Avon Wharf. However, a project was completed in
2017 to upgrade the Avon Marine Terminal to the
latest Marine Oil Terminal Engineering & Maintenance
Standards that considered potential sea-level rise
in its design. As part of the permit for the project, a
technical memorandum estimating future water levels
at the Avon terminal was prepared. The assessment
projects that 2030 water levels would increase by
approximately 2.7 inches (0.221 feet), resulting from an
extreme tide or 100-year flood conditions and that the
Avon terminal pipeway infrastructure would not be
inundated (Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger Inc., 2021).
The assessment further concluded that, assuming a
measured water-level rise of approximately 0.1 inch
per year, the pipelines would not likely be inundated

until 2070, which provides adequate time to monitor
and mitigate any potential impacts.
Several of our terminals showed minor impacts
above 3 feet of sea-level rise, which is at the high
end of the likely range in a high-emissions scenario.
However, because of the chronic nature of sea-level
rise, we believe there is adequate time to monitor
and mitigate any potential impacts to these assets.
In 2023, updates to elevation in the Florida region
recategorized two of our four terminals from being
in a low-level area with 3 feet of sea-level rise and
the potential for flooding to having no indication of
flooding.
While we can use different scenarios and tools to
screen for potential risks, the actual acute and chronic
physical risks faced by our facilities in the future are
not certain. As such, we have developed mature
systems designed to effectively manage these risks
through our ERM process.

WATER AVAILABILITY AND DROUGHT
Fresh water is essential to sustaining life. Our
society relies on water for food, health, livelihoods
and recreation. Water is also vital to our operations.
It is used to add heat to our refining process (as
steam), remove heat from the process (as cooling
water), remove impurities from crude oil, protect
equipment from corrosion, control emissions and
clean equipment during maintenance activities.
Water availability and other water risks, such as water
quality, are a major concern throughout much of the
world, including parts of the U.S. Population growth,
together with a changing climate, could further
exacerbate these water risks. Climate change could
intensify short- and long-term drought risk across the
southwest United States. A drought could reduce or

eliminate water sources normally available to a facility.
As shown below, our two facilities located in areas
with the highest water risk, as indicated by a World
Resources Institute tool1, are our Los Angeles refinery
and the Martinez Renewable Fuels joint venture.
The Los Angeles refinery has a diverse source of
water supply, which helps minimize the risk of one
source being restrained. In some areas, drought
and associated periods of high temperatures could
contribute to dry conditions that drive wildfires.
During drought, water utilities may face a reduced
volume of water or loss of water supply sources,
while experiencing increased demand from
customers, requiring a decrease in use and water
availability. During severe drought conditions,
authorities may implement water rationing measures

on certain industries in order of priority or
contractual agreement.
To manage risk surrounding water use, in 2020, we
adopted a formal Focus on Water program, which is
designed to assess site water use and understand
and mitigate water risks. To further the program’s
success, we also established a companywide
target to reduce freshwater withdrawal intensity by
20% below 2016 levels by 2030. To date, we have
achieved an 18% reduction in intensity below 2016
levels, which equates to over 3.5 billion gallons of
fresh water saved per year. Projects identified by
the Focus on Water program have the potential to
save an additional 500 million gallons of fresh water
per year.

Climate-Related Metrics and Targets
The suite of targets below helps measure progress with our climate strategy and risk management
processes. We assess progress with these targets on an annual basis and may modify them or adopt new
metrics as we achieve our goals or as new sources of information come to light. Our performance to date
has resulted in real, sustainable emissions reductions and significant investment in the energy evolution.

Since 2019, we have reduced absolute Scope
1, 2 and 3 - Category 11 GHG emissions by
more than 25 million tonnes per year on a
sustainable basis.

We are planning to take the following actions relating to our metrics:
• Extend our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity target to a 38% reduction by 2035 from 2014 levels.
• Continue to evaluate potential adjustments to our absolute Scope 3 - Category 11 target given the wide variability in demand for our products being modeled in 1.5
degree scenarios, the relative strength of our assets compared to the global refining sector, and the significant uncertainty surrounding Scope 3 accounting and the
use of offsets or divestments in light of the recently-issued U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission climate disclosure rules, which are stayed pending judicial review.
Please see Page 33 for more information.
• Evaluate potential adjustments to our methane targets as we complete initiatives to incorporate a more measurement-informed inventory. Please see Page 34 for more
information.

Data before 2019 is inclusive of facilities that MPC did not yet own so that performance can be compared across the same asset base over time.

We utilize several reporting protocols and guidance documents to develop and compute our GHG emissions and targets, including: U.S. EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule reporting protocols (40
CFR Part 98), the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), Greenhouse Gas Protocol, and Ipieca’s petroleum industry guidelines for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Beginning in 2020, an independent third
party, LRQA, has validated our GHG data and emissions calculation methodologies related to the above metrics. This comprehensive review and assurance promotes accurate disclosures that align with accepted
reporting practices. The latest assurance statement can be found at https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/content/documents/Responsibility/Reports_Policies/2024/2023_LRQA_Assurance_Statement.pdf.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions Intensity Target

We have achieved a significant reduction through
multiple initiatives, including our Focus on Energy
program, the acquisition and expansion of our MPLX
G&P business, along with our growth in renewable
fuels.
We have achieved significant energy savings, GHG
reductions and costs savings through our Focus
on Energy program. This includes avoiding the
equivalent of over 1.5 billion Btu/hour of energy use,
which saved over $45 million in 2023. This is roughly
the same amount of energy used by over 90,000
homes or 160,000 gasoline-powered passenger
vehicles.1 As a five-time EPA ENERGY STAR® Partner
of the Year — Sustained Excellence award recipient,
we are an active participant in the program, sharing
our strategies and successes with other industrial
companies.

We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2
GHG intensity for the ninth straight
year, for a 27% reduction since 2014.

• Achieved a reduction in our intensity for the ninth
consecutive year demonstrating the resiliency and
effectiveness of our Focus on Energy program.

As we are on track to reach our existing
goal prior to 2030, we are extending
the target to a 38% reduction by 2035.

• Since 2014, GHG emissions from our refinery flares
have decreased by over 30%.
• Since 2019, our companywide Scope 1 and 2 GHG
emissions have decreased by over 10% on an
absolute basis.
• Five refineries (Anacortes, Washington; Canton,
Ohio; Garyville, Louisiana; Robinson, Illinois; St.
Paul Park, Minnesota) received 2023 ENERGY
STAR certifications for being in the top 25% of
similar facilities nationwide on the basis of energy
efficiency. MPC has earned more certifications than
all other refining companies combined. Please see

Focus on Energy (FOE)
IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY

REFINING ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Energy efficiency is one of our key metrics with both
environmental and financial benefits. By identifying
where energy can be conserved cost effectively, we
reduce our operating costs, save money and reduce
our environmental footprint. Our FOE program is
our holistic approach to improving energy efficiency
in our refining organization to drive continuous
improvement and reduce GHG emissions. In the
past decade, our FOE program helped us avoid the
equivalent of several billion Btu/hr of energy use.

With FOE programs in place at all 13 of our refineries,
we’ve expanded these efforts to include our
renewable facilities. In 2023, key performance
indicators were developed for the Martinez
Renewable Fuels facility, with plans to duplicate
efforts for the Dickinson Renewable Fuels facility.

Through the success of our FOE program, MPC has
been recognized by the EPA for our contributions to
building an energy efficiency economy, winning the
2024 ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year – Sustained
Excellence Award. ENERGY STAR is a voluntary
program managed by the U.S. EPA that aims to
assist industry in improving energy efficiency and
reducing environmental impact. This honor, MPC’s
fifth consecutive, puts the company in a distinguished
group.

• Identify and track energy operating parameters

Significant Refining Energy Wins
As a part of our Focus on Energy program, we have
energy coordinators at our refineries who:
• Develop and implement energy conservation
roadmaps
• Consider energy efficiency in the scope of new
projects
St. Paul Park Insulation Improvements
The St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery completed a
three-year project to reinforce insulation across the
entire site, which is lowering energy consumption
and is anticipated to reduce GHG emissions by nearly
16,000 tonnes per year.

The Partner of the Year – Sustained Excellence Award
is the highest level of recognition in the EPA’s ENERGY
STAR program. Only approximately 20 industrial companies in the U.S. received
this designation in 2024. Winning companies must go above and beyond the
criteria for Partner of the Year recognition by showing continuous improvement
over time in organizationwide energy savings and environmental performance,
demonstrating best practices and actively promoting the ENERGY STAR
program.

Garyville Steam Optimization
Garyville's Technical Services Department optimized
reboilers on a propylene tower, which removes
ethane and other light components from refinerygrade propylene, and a butamer stabilizer tower,
which separates off-gas and chlorides from
isobutane. These two optimizations can save over
10,000 pounds per hour of steam and reduce carbon
dioxide-equivalent emissions by approximately 7,000
metric tonnes per year.

Catlettsburg Steam System Improvements
A multiyear project has addressed the root cause
of steam leaks and steam trap issues by improving
management of condensate used as feedwater
for four steam generators. This project reduces
degradation of the condensate and steam system
by lessening the wear and tear on the system. This
project anticipates a 40% reduction in steam leaks
and steam trap failure that will lower steam demand
by as much as 30,000 pounds per hour, or the
equivalent of approximately 10,700 metric tonnes of
carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions.

MIDSTREAM ENERGY EFFICIENCY
To build upon the success of our refinery-specific FOE program, MPC expanded
FOE with programs now in progress at various MPLX facilities.

Significant Midstream Energy Wins
As part of the ENERGY STAR program, the EPA launched the ENERGY STAR
Challenge for Industry in 2010 to encourage manufacturing plants to decrease
GHG emissions, generate momentum for energy savings, establish good energy
management practices, increase visibility of energy management efforts and
motivate employees to support energy initiatives. MPLX recognized the potential
benefits for the company, its customers and the public. MPLX marked an industry
first by entering the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry in December 2022.
Bluestone Gas Processing Facility
MPLX's Bluestone gas processing facility is the first facility in the midstream natural
gas processing sector to enter the Challenge for Industry. Since its inception,
energy intensity has been reduced at Bluestone by approximately 12% within 24
months, with aspirations to reduce this energy intensity further. This has avoided
an estimated 50,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions.
To build on the success of Bluestone, additional MPLX gas processing facilities
have recently entered into the ENERGY STAR Challenge, namely the Houston,
Pennsylvania, facility, which is the largest gas processor in Pennsylvania, and the
Sherwood, West Virginia, facility, which is the largest gas processing facility in the
United States. As the ENERGY STAR program becomes more established within
our midstream operations, we expect there will be opportunities to expand it to
additional facilities, which will further reduce company energy use.

MPLX's Bluestone natural gas plant in Pennsylvania
reduced its energy intensity by approximately 10% within
just one year of establishing a baseline as part of the
ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry. This achievement
in part helped MPC receive the ENERGY STAR® Partner
of the Year – Sustained Excellence Award, which the EPA
presents at its discretion.

MPC’s Evolving View of Scope 3 GHG Emissions
MPC’s absolute Scope 3 - Category 11 emissions target is related to production from
our petroleum refining assets. When we established the target in February of 2022, we
considered expectations from our shareholders and the overall refining outlook. It was
also informed by the criteria provided in the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Oil and
Gas Sector draft guidance. From the time our target was set, the aforementioned items
have shifted and regulatory uncertainty has emerged:

• Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a global energy crisis that altered the global
energy landscape. Regions like the U.S. have had to compensate for the altered global
fuel supply due to the impacts the conflict had on regional refining capacity and output.
Energy prices surged, governments began prioritizing energy security, and U.S. refined
product exports have spiked.
• The current pace of the energy evolution has recalibrated as evidenced by lower
projected reductions in oil demand by IEA and other agencies. Refer to Page 12 for
more information.
• The SBTi instituted a policy to pause target commitments and validations for fossil fuel
companies.1 The work to finalize science-based target setting methods and guidance for
oil and gas companies remains in development.

• The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules to enhance and
standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. The
rule includes disclosure requirements for climate-related targets. On April 4, 2024, the
SEC voluntarily stayed the rule, pending judicial review. There is significant uncertainty
as to the timeline and outcome, considering the litigation pertaining to the rule.

Note: 2020 data is not representative of a normal year because
production was impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns.

Beyond the aforementioned items, oil demand is at a record high globally, and we expect
oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. The forecast outlook
for this year estimates about 1 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023,
primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels.2 However, global supply
remains constrained. Anticipated capacity additions have progressed more slowly than
expected, and the level of announced capacity additions remains limited for the rest of
the decade. There is also uncertainty as to how the world will progress toward the Paris
Agreement's objective to limit global warming, which includes a multitude of scenarios
with varying levels of oil demand as outlined on Page 12.

Depending on the outcome of these and other factors, future
adjustments to our Scope 3 - Category 11 target may be necessary.

Methane Emissions Intensity Reduction Target

PURSUIT OF MEASUREMENTINFORMED INVENTORY
We continue to pursue more measurement-informed
methane emissions data from our MPLX G&P assets
to supplement the methane emissions inventory
mandated by U.S. EPA’s Mandatory GHG Reporting
Rule (40 CFR Part 98). As outlined in our 2022 report,
we performed extensive monitoring and verification
of methane emissions across our MPLX G&P assets
through our involvement in The Environmental
Partnership and collaboration with Cheniere Energy,
Inc. All commitments were completed with a
comprehensive top-down/bottom-up gap analysis.
The EPA recently issued updates to its GHG reporting
rule, which are effective for 2025 emissions to be
reported in 2026. These updates include significantly
higher emission factors for compressor engines due
to methane slip. Our extensive testing indicated that
our fleet generally operates at a lower rate than the
updated emission factors, but at rates higher than the
factors used in the current rule. The higher emissions
from compressor engines and other sources are
expected to increase our baseline and current annual
reported methane emissions by over 20,000 tonnes.

34

As a result, we are evaluating ways to reduce the
methane slip from compressor engines through
potential retrofits and optimization. A new program,
Equipment, Compression Health & Optimization, was
rolled out and tested to optimize engine operation
and determine methane slip reduction potential.

We deployed Bridger Photonics technology on
aircraft and performed data analysis in collaboration
with The Environmental Partnership. This led to
a 2024 flight campaign to further improve our
understanding of our emissions profile and our ability
to respond to emissions data.

Some additional methane verification measures
we are implementing across our MPLX G&P assets
include routine monitoring of our compressor
stations using optical gas imaging, pilot testing
continuous fence line methane monitoring systems
and participating in a West Virginia University study
of storage tank emissions within the Marcellus Shale
region. We also joined the Appalachian Methane
Initiative in 2023 - a coalition of major U.S. natural
gas operators aimed at enhancing monitoring in the
Appalachian Basin and facilitating reductions in the
region.

METHANE EMISSIONS INTENSITY
TARGETS

REDUCING METHANE EMISSIONS
FROM OUR OPERATIONS
As shown to the right, since 2016, we have
implemented measures that have achieved over
10,000 tonnes per year of methane emissions
reductions through our Focus on Methane program.
Even using the revised factors in EPA's updated GHG
reporting rule, we remain a very efficient operator
with overall MPLX emissions intensity near the
Inflation Reduction Act targets set for our industry
segments. Additional details regarding our achieved
and planned methane emissions reductions can be
found on the next page.
In 2023, we met our goal to install low-emissions
packing and test ports at 50% of our reciprocating
compressors. LDAR monitoring is occurring at 100%
of our compressor stations, even those not requiring
permit or regulatory LDAR.

As a result of new data and revised emissions factors
for select equipment, we plan to update our methane
targets by the time reporting occurs under the
updated rule to reflect changes in the assumptions
that were used to set our targets. This additional time
will allow us to evaluate options to reduce emissions
from a variety of sources. This includes performing
further testing of compressor engines and ways to
reduce methane slip.

in methane emissions is a high priority for meeting
society’s GHG emissions reduction goals over the
next 5 to 15 years. We remain focused on reducing

Freshwater Withdrawal Intensity Reduction Target
Fresh water is vital to society and our operations. It
is used to add heat to our manufacturing process (as
steam), remove heat from the process (as cooling
water), remove impurities from crude oil, protect
equipment from corrosion, control emissions and
clean equipment during maintenance activities.

resulting in less freshwater demand. On the boiler
systems, the water cycles of concentration were
optimized on low pressure heat boilers, also resulting
in less freshwater usage.

Water availability is a major concern throughout
much of the world, including parts of the United
States. Population growth, together with a changing
climate, could further exacerbate global water stress.
As shown on Page 27, our Los Angeles refinery and
Martinez Renewable Fuels joint venture are located in
areas designated as high for water risk as defined by
the Global Reporting Initiative and World Resources
Institute assessment tools.

The El Paso refinery reduced freshwater usage
by over 25 million gallons by focusing on water
management. This was achieved through
modifications to their tank hydrostatic testing
procedures and increasing cycles of concentration in
their water treatment system.

GALVESTON BAY REFINERY
Galveston Bay completed a project to increase the
capacity of their reverse osmosis system, allowing
more water to be reused. Approximately 68 million
gallons of freshwater was saved by diverting more
reverse osmosis reject water for reuse.

Highlights from the Focus on Water program in 2023
include:

SALT LAKE CITY REFINERY
The Salt Lake City Refinery has lowered its steam
consumption, energy use and water use by
optimizing the flow of stripping steam to its main
amine regenerator. Over 700 pounds per hour of
steam were saved as well as over 700 thousand
gallons of water.

The Los Angeles refinery implemented several
changes to cooling tower and steam boiler operations,
resulting in over 600 million gallons of water saved, in
2023. The facility updated the iron specification limits
to reduce both freshwater and chemical usage. Level
controls on cooling tower basins were also improved,

MPC Freshwater Withdrawal Intensity

Our Martinez facility was recently converted to a
renewable diesel facility from a petroleum refinery.
At full capacity, this facility is expected to use
approximately 1 billion fewer gallons of freshwater per
year than when it operated as a petroleum refinery.

To manage risk surrounding freshwater use in 2020,
we adopted a formal Focus on Water program. The
program is designed to assess site freshwater use,
understand and mitigate water risks, and identify
opportunities to reduce freshwater use. We have
implemented the Focus on Water program at all of
our refineries and are paying special attention to our
plants located in California, Texas and Utah where
water stress is higher than at our other locations.

EL PASO REFINERY

To ensure success of the Focus on
Water program, we established
a companywide target to reduce
freshwater withdrawal intensity 20%
by 2030 from 2016 levels. To date,
we have achieved an 18% reduction
in intensity below 2016 levels.

estimates and projections concerning its business and operations, financial priorities, strategic plans and initiatives, capital return plans, capital expenditure plans, operating cost reduction objectives, and
environmental, social and governance (ESG) plans and goals. Forward-looking and other statements regarding our ESG plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are material to investors or are
required to be disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the context of this disclosure, the term “material” is distinct from, and should not be confused with, such term as defined
for SEC reporting purposes. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “commitment,” “could,” “design,” “endeavor”, “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,”
“intend,” “may,” “objective,” “opportunity,” “outlook,” “plan,“ “policy,” “position,” “potential,” “predict,” “priority,” “progress”, “project,” “prospective,” “pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “strive”, “target,” “trends”, “will,”
“would” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.
Forward-looking statements in this document include, among other things, statements regarding our ESG plans and goals, including those related to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
intensity targets; methane emissions intensity targets; freshwater withdrawal intensity targets; Scope 3 – Category 11 GHG emissions reduction targets; success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated

ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline, which we refer to as “NGLs”; the timing, amount and form of any future capital return transactions, including dividends and share repurchases by MPC or distributions
and unit repurchases by MPLX; the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, activist investors, federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities, or plaintiffs in litigation.
We caution that these statements are based on management’s current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to:
general economic, political or regulatory developments, including changes in governmental policies relating to refined petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs, GHG emissions, or renewables, or taxation;
the regional, national and worldwide demand for refined products, natural gas and renewables and related margins; the regional, national or worldwide availability and pricing of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and
other feedstocks and related pricing differentials; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated projects, including meeting the expected production rates for the projects within the expected
timeframes, if at all; the timing and ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and permits and to satisfy other conditions necessary to complete planned projects or to consummate planned transactions within
the expected timeframes if at all; the availability of desirable strategic alternatives to optimize portfolio assets and the ability to obtain regulatory and other approvals with respect thereto; the inability or failure of our
joint venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the financing and distribution decisions of joint ventures we do not control; our ability to successfully implement our sustainable
energy strategy and principles and achieve our ESG plans and goals within the expected timeframes, if at all; the occurrence of industrial accidents; changes in government incentives for emission reduction
products and technologies; the outcome of research and development efforts to create future technologies necessary to achieve our ESG plans and goals; the availability of feedstocks for lower-emission fuels;
